Then there were the Brazilians everywhere singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs,joy

We are all essentially the same person,joy
other then physical attributes - what really makes us so different from one another,joy
Theoretically,joy
is there anything that Einstein did that I couldn't do,joy
we both have the same tools (a brain) so why can't I come up with a grad theory of relativity,joy
Simply because that is not where I have been directing my energy to,joy
The brain is an amazing tool and can be sculpted for any purpose,joy
however most people don't exert the mental energy required to expand your train of thought,joy
Have you ever met anyone without a fully developed brain?,joy
They look at things only on the surface and read into nothing,joy
Listlessly they scratch at there head and the chains of thought don't delve to deep,joy
I think it is very easy to understand people once you realize that all people carry all the same personalities - just expressed to different proportions and degrees,joy
Whatever thought can be imagined - someone has taken that to the extreme,joy
the combination of all people balanced into one,joy
as defined by the dictionary,joy
Balanced,joy
(of a person or state of mind) having no emotion lacking or too strong; stable : a balanced personality,joy

The testes stop producing testosterone because it senses there is already too much testosterone in the system,joy

So this morning I get a phone call from my sister,joy

I almost bought this cool shiney glass tumbler up thingy,joy
I was dragged away (it will be there tomorrow and I can go back alone),joy
Ok the alignment was out on her BMW when she bought it and it wiped out the tires,joy
I tend to think not,joy
She said that a mechanic told her that the frame was bent,joy
I called the mechanic and inquired about it,joy
On that car it won't affect alignment,joy
I have twice the work experience required for the job and I have alot more schooling than is required,joy
I got her less than $50000 back,joy
So when she writes her letter to the Commissioner and the director of vehicle safety reads my report he will understand why I appear not to take her side,joy
I made lunch for a luncheon at work yesterday,joy
They saw what I meant when they started eating it,joy

For instance if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time my need for connection has not been met,joy

We can become conscious of what is going on inside us,joy
Marshall Rosenberg author of Nonviolent Communication has a four-step process for communication that incorporates identifying our feelings and needs into the model,joy
Rosenberg also calls this four step process giraffe language,joy
He coined it giraffe language because the giraffe has the largest heart of all the mammals,joy
The heart is about 3 feet long and 3 inches thick all around,joy
If we are not correct they will correct us and we will be closer to identifying the need they have and finding a way to resolve the situation,joy
By satisfying our needs and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation,joy
We can make a list of these feelings and be on the look out for them,joy
Then when we are calm focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others,joy
For more information on Nonviolent Communication click here,joy
Highlights:,joy
- Help out with a conference at Bouremouth with the Conservative party had the 'privelage' of taking of THe Mr Cameron and his whole entourage,joy

Yep,joy
I dunno what else to say though except it's shocking that I'm updating early,joy
AGAIN,joy
Other than that I also got a extension from my affiliate to get the fanlisiting I adopted up since the server move and etc Meh I miss Cassy,joy
T_T eheh,joy
Though I was allowed to stay up until 1 AM last night,joy
But heh thats basically it,joy
Theres nothing left to say so this is the end of my journal entry,joy
Well short one anyway,joy
This is my update for today and I am off,joy
It's the veils,joy
Yes the veils that many Muslim women around the world traditionally wear,joy
I'm not going to get into the wrongs and rights just to give a bit of perspective,joy
Listen,joy
Let's clarify,joy
Hijab is a headscarf that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck,joy
The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes or in some cases nothing at all,joy
Taleban style if you will,joy
This is called the nikab,joy
For clarification the difference should be noted,joy
Hijab in Islam actually means modesty or privacy,joy
And it is believed that women should practice modesty both for themselves but to keep the gazing eyes of man down,joy
The khimar is the actual headscarf,joy
The veil that covers the entire face is called the nikab,joy
Islam requires women to be modest henceforth many of them wear the hijab or headscarf,joy
The nikab or taliban style cover is not an Islamic practice,joy
A Fatwa or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam (just like the west has some Christian right wackies),joy
It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities,joy
Jack Straw is calling for a ban of veils or nikabs in the UK,joy
Not the ban on hijabs,joy
But if the UK Muslims are listening to Mr Livingstone he's on to something,joy
He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community,joy
Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this,joy
I'm by no means an expert on veils,joy
What I do know is that there are many many woman who absolutely voluntarily and willingly cover themselves with a headscarf for religious purposes,joy
So the voluntary and involuntary,joy
The Brits haven't ventured that far they accept the head scarf but oppose the ninja turtle look,joy
Turkey has a similar issue,joy
In its bid to become a secular society -- and to integrate into the unwelcoming arms of the European Union it has forbidden even the nikab and in some places even the hijab in public schools and universities,joy
Sarajevo now has a large female Turkish population coming to study here so they can wear what they wish,joy
Bosnian Islam is very secular and indeed seen by most European leaders as a model example of the type of Islam they want being taught in their increasing number of mosques and madressa's within the EU,joy
The question of hijab and nikabs hasn't come up yet here in Bosnia,joy
The hijab is accepted and tolerated as are the nikab wearers (which is an extremely small percentage of Muslim women),joy
The progressive west is certainly faltering when it comes to questions of its growing Muslim populations and addressing the cultural and religious difference between east and west,joy
This door has to swing both ways,joy
The west must do more to grasp the concepts of Islam - and understand the vast cultural differences even with the large and diverse Muslim community which covers three continents,joy
If western women can run around half naked can eastern women completely cover themselves?,joy
Is there really a difference?,joy
We all need to take the veils off,joy
and look at each other eye to eye,joy
Brother to brother face to face let's unite the human race,joy
I'm EXTREMELY sad to say that it looks as though The Skyline Obscura will be on an indefinate hiatus as of this past Thursday,joy
With that some of the new songs that never were will be posted shortly for those of you who want to hear it,joy
Sorry for the letdown and I can't speak for everyone else but I'd rather have this happen now than later,joy
Feel free to contact any of us individually about this if you feel so compelled as nobody's really going to be monitoring this site any more,joy
(our individual pages are under the members section),joy
Thanks for the support!,joy
You'll all receive notices of any Skyline updates and/or updates of new projects involving anyone from TSO (past or pseudo-present),joy
Take care of each other,joy
Well my MIL arrived yesterday,joy
My SIL and niece came over yesterday afternoon to collect our great-nephew Brandon,joy
He wanted B to stay at least for today so that he had a day off to play with him,joy
Brandon's dad Michael is improving,joy
Hey how has everyone been lately?,joy
It's been a while,joy
and there has been so much going on,joy
and it's been just a big jumble of AWOIWEJFPWKSFWEIONMQMEM!,joy
lol just kidding,joy
Especially people,joy
lol),joy
Anyway this past week has been one of the busiest ones yet for me and maybe for you too,joy
Sometimes all we need is that little encouragement or motivation to get us going again,joy
like the energizer bunny!!!,joy
:D lol wow,joy
Okay that's about it for now,joy
What I completed in one day today was not possible to me last week,joy
Today I can say I actually taught for all three of my periods,joy
I walked into my first period only to find a sub,joy
I asked the sub if he did not mind my taking over and of course he complied,joy
I figured I knew the material more than he did and more importantly I knew the students and how the class should run,joy
So the bell rang the sub introduced himself and I took over,joy
I had them write in their journals for a few minutes then proceeded to facilitate the day's assignments,joy
I allowed them 10-15 minutes to finish up the work from yesterday before we began a new piece of literature,joy
After they turned that in I introduced Poor Richard's Almanacwhich we read as a class,joy
This was a very short reading so I gave the class an assignment to go along with the reading,joy
They had the remainder of the class to complete the assignment while I went around to monitor their work and answer questions,joy
The period ran smoothly under my direction most suprisingly to me I actually liked being thrown into the situation without having prior knowledge,joy
For today's lesson I taught them how to determine the mood in a piece of literature based on the definition an example and a story out of their literature books,joy
I began my lesson by explaining what the term mood meant,joy
I explained to them that the mood of the story could be determined based on the word choice used by the author,joy
To give them a better understanding of how mood works I presented them with a paragraph that I wrote on the overhead,joy
I had them follow along as I read out loud,joy
After I was done reading my paragraph I had the students tell me what was the mood I had created,joy
Almost everyone participated and for every type of mood they came up with I had them point out places in the paragraph that helped them to determine the mood,joy
That was a segway into today's story,joy
Today we read The Talk by Gary Soto,joy
I gave a brief background on the author and the story before we began,joy
I read the first paragraph then I drew names out of my little tin container to complete the reading,joy
After certain spots I would have them go over plot summary just to make sure they were following along,joy
At the end of the story I had them do the same thing they did with my paragraph to determine the mood,joy
After a discussion I asked them to take out a piece of paper,joy
They answered on their papers then shared out as a class,joy
This completed my very first lesson for periods 3 amp; 6,joy
Wow I hardly ever have plans,joy
I went to the OVAC volleyball tournament this morning and was gone almost all day and I'm going skating with one of my friends tonight,joy
Got to go out for breakfast with the team even though I'm not a member,joy
I'm the libero tracker,joy
The libero is a defensive specialist and I have to keep track of who she goes in and out for,joy
Today rocks!,joy
She's not a skating-type person though,joy
We always try to get her to come but it doesn't work,joy
We'll just have to drag her down to the rink one of these days lol!,joy
xx I need to invest in a pair of blades,joy
I outgrew my skates and I don't like renting,joy
Plus I've heard blades are easier than four-wheels and I can use all the help I can get,joy
o___x,joy
Stephenie Meyer,joy
What can I say?,joy
She's amazing,joy
This list is very short,joy
In fact there's only about three authors whose books I will buy no matter the storyline,joy
Meyer JK Rowling and Meg Cabot,joy
And yes I read hundreds thousands of books from other people,joy
But these female writes,joy
I'm a writer,joy
I know that,joy
I'm enough of a grown-up to say it,joy
And after reading Stephenie's story about how real her characters are,joy
how they can take over her outlines,joy
The story leads me not the people who grace the page,joy
And Stephenie says that we should know our characters,joy
Sigh,joy
Well I know that a lot of my LJ friends are writers too,joy
I can tell,joy
hm,joy
Well any advice on writing would be appreciated,joy
You know you're from Massachusetts when,joy
When ordering a tonic you mean a Coke,joy
not quinine water,joy
You know how to pronounce the names of towns like Worcester Billerica Haverhill Barre and Cotuit,joy
You know that there are two Bulger brothers and that they're both crooks,joy
You know what they sell at a packie,joy
You know at least one bar where you can get something to drink after last call,joy
You can actually find your way around Boston,joy
You know at least one guy named Sean Pat Whitey Red Bud or Seamus,joy
You have never been to Cheers,joy
You have gone to at least one party at UMass,joy
You own a Yankees Suck shirt or hat,joy

You actually know how to merge from 6 lanes of traffic down to one,joy
You never go to Cape Cod you go down the Cape,joy
You're aware that there is a town somewhere in Massachusetts named Brimfield where they have the biggest outdoor antique market in the world,joy
You can drive to the mountains and the ocean all in one day,joy
You know that the Mass Pike is some sort of strange weather dividing line,joy
You know that P-Town isn't the name of a new rap group,joy
You do not recognize the letter R as a part of the English language,joy
You keep an ice scraper and can of de-icer on the floor of your car,joy
So ok this happened like week before last but I thought it was funny enough to mention today,joy
So Brandon and I were chilling out one night at home after being out all night and we decided to step out on the patio for a quick smoke,joy
The cops come outta nowhere this time,joy
They all fly off in EVERY direction to find this kid (of course except the direction I said he went),joy
The cops spend more time driving down my road then they probably should,joy
There are moments in our lives when we find ourselves at a crossroad,joy
The choices we make in these moments can define the rest of our days,joy
But once in a while people push on,joy
Into something better,joy
And it's only when you're tested that you discover who you can be,joy
My worst fears have been personified,joy
I have no details,joy
No dates,joy
No times,joy
No nothing,joy
I only know that it could be anytime within the next 60 days,joy
Hey guys!,joy
=P,joy
^_^;,joy
HEY,joy
If you don't know what to get me for christmas get me some socks!!,joy
~Apple ipod socks,joy
As for my diet,joy
Eh,joy
its not that much but hey its something!,joy
^_^,joy
the season is changing,joy
again,joy
a lot of things have happened to me in the past six months since the beginning of summer,joy
though I do not mind this one tiny bit it has been odd for me I'm rarely the strong one,joy
something it seems I am getting more and more used to,joy
didn't see that one coming,joy
now I have no idea what I believe and what I want to do and how I want to spend the rest of my life,joy
well maybe I do,joy
but that scares me even more,joy
and well I got married,joy
I find myself again stuck in a place where I have to rediscover myself all over again,joy
maybe I do,joy
but I don't want to admit that yet,joy
though I think I have,joy
so stay tuned,joy
changes to come,joy
perhaps too much so for 5:15 on a saturday afternoon but hey what can you do,joy
gotta milk those quarter-life crises for all they're worth,joy
don't get another one for 25 more years,joy
I must go now,joy
have a great idea for a new scarf,joy
want to get it done in time for the next snowfall,joy
Well I seem to have done that,joy
I was just scared,joy
I mean,joy
I'm scared of my future,joy
I look around me and you know what I see?,joy
I just can't help it,joy
But then I also think what if they are the right person?,joy
Some people say Katrina do thisothers say Katrina do that,joy
What do I say?,joy
I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!!!!,joy
Welp today has been a long tiring day lol,joy
lol,joy
He's sleeping now but everytime I lay down and think I will get atleast a couple hours of sleep hes right back up!,joy
lol,joy
He sleeps most of the day and then never sleeps at night,joy
I am not to thrilled about going over there,joy
lol and so we figgured we would just go to Six Flags,joy
HAHA!,joy
thats what you get for rubbing it in my face that your 21 and im not!),joy
LOL,joy
Almost sounds like an EMO song title,joy
Maybe it is I dunno,joy
All I know is that I have no time to do anything anymore,joy
At least the price of gas is going down $199 per gallon across the street now,joy
I'm also working at the YMCA every Monday in October which helps but makes me tired as all get out,joy
The job is still just that,joy
I have a new pic of Melissa and I which I will post shortly,joy
We need a new pic,joy
Bagpiping got moved to one of our together nights so that puts a small damper on the time we see each other for every week,joy
Oh well at least we can make it work without lots of time,joy
It's kinda far from where I am but it is worth it,joy
The indoor range has 8 lanes but is only 15 yards long,joy
We are starting to get some interesting inquiries,joy
Also since I belong to a variety of social organizations it was easy to make concert contacts through them,joy
Who knows where we will be playing in 2007,joy
I have my eyes on a few locations like Kwajalein RMI and Soto Cano-Honduras; with friends in low places we'll probably get those gigs,joy
The list of folks who want a copy of the CD-First Light is being built up one name at a time,joy
Anyone who wants one I will send one,joy
Ha!,joy
Wouldn't that be a gig!?,joy
In the mean time I am going after every venue available,joy
Leaving for Irvine on the 18th for Maiden,joy
See you mates up front of Arrys monitor!,joy
I'm at Penn State for the weekend,joy
Tonight is the Michigan vs PSU game,joy
Tonight is also the drag show which I shall be attending faithfully,joy
Wow,joy
I'm reading this back to myself and I'm totally yawning,joy
Let's face it,joy
I don't drink anymore,joy
Hard alcohol would surely have put me in the ER,joy
And this hair,joy
Lex Squared told me that she could do something with my hair,joy
That's a polite way of saying,joy
I'm staying with Kristen Ward,joy
She has 4 boys staying her who attend West Point,joy
Hi,joy
They're cute,joy
So I toned down the performance and slept until right now,joy
I almost died,joy
Look at me! I'm like Ellen on straight television,joy
I'm a maneater!,joy
Oh and Ps!,joy
Totally mine,joy
I feel like I should be writting right now,joy
The other week I was at Roxy with Robbie and company and the crack house came up,joy
How much you give me for this Bacon?,joy
nevermind I've got an Arabic test I could be studying for,joy
ones worth retelling?,joy
Within a week I bid on and won about 14 cookie jars,joy
They are just so cute I can't resist them although I think I am under control now,joy
At least I haven't bought any in about four days,joy
I still have six that have not arrived yet,joy
Oh well I will find space or have Tim build me some shelves,joy
One cookie jar was not packed well,joy
HE KNEW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT PACKING he said,joy
Well needless to say his packing job was far below any I have seen so far,joy
Man I just can't seem to keep out of trouble,joy
I even sold a few things on Ebay,joy
Will have to work on that enterprise,joy
Tim and I have been fishing and camping,joy
There always seems to be much to do around here and we don't seem to get much done,joy
Or at least I don't,joy
Tim is working on putting a border fence up in the front of the property,joy
Then he wants to put in an underground sprinkler system before we plant grass in front,joy
We also will be planting trees and shrubs in front and some day putting a small deck coming out of the front door,joy
We have come a long way in a year though!,joy
Well must go put dinner in the oven,joy
Homemade macaroni and cheese,joy
With all this cheese we will probably be constipated tomorrow,joy
Mmk,joy
Thursday:,joy
Then later hung out with some loser until like 12,joy
Friday:,joy
Chels and I cleaned my room which was much needed,joy
Then Ashlie and Becky came and picked me up we stopped at Joey's to see if they had any applications then went out to the mall so I could turn in some apps and so Ashlie could buy some underwears,joy
I came home and got my stuff together to go up to the kid's camp,joy
Even after getting off the phone with her I balled forever,joy
It was sooo cold out seeing as I don't have a winter jacket or anything,joy
It was real lame,joy
Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting,joy
Today Chels made me a sandwhich since she loves me and I had some soup so I feel better,joy
I'm going out for a little tonight and then I'm gonna see if Ash and Beck want to stay,joy
Then Tomorrow,joy
It all started a month ago in kickboxing class (at least that part sounds way cool),joy
The new instructor is a former marine and showed us these five-pointed-star push-ups,joy
Anyway I get home and notice my knee feels kinda tight,joy
But after a month that hasn't really happened,joy
So I'm old but I have these really cute Etienne Aigner boots to show for it,joy
Well you know what?,joy
In the last fifteen years ,joy
my life has been somewhat conventional:,joy
job wife two kids house car,joy
Seen from a distance I've been following the script ,joy
the path that society lays down for people like me,joy
have been when we have turned the script upside-down;,joy
skipped a line or a page or an act;,joy
swapped parts;,joy
cut pages up and rearranged them;,joy
This is me my self-fashioned self,joy
I will not play the part that others have chosen for me,joy
This happened again today,joy
Sucks for Levon but he said he wouldn't let me drive with the trailer anyways,joy
But I'm free til' Aug 31st,joy
Everybody call me Just letting you all know I suck at at tests,joy
first: heh heh heh so appropriate fer me,joy
I dunno press the button and find out,joy
second,joy
couldn't the fucking terrorists decide to get caught you know after I landed?,joy
no of course not,joy
or convert everyone to Islam or just blow you up one by one in a fucking plane train or automobile,joy
let me calculate how long that'll take with current rates of reproduction and the current world population,joy
never,joy
so fuck off,joy
you've killed less people in the last six years than we did to ourselves in a week in 1916,joy
so fuck off,joy
we do it much better anyway,joy
that's all that matters isn't it?,joy
the state of our souls,joy
more virgins for you,joy
the quota might drop to 45 or something,joy
I'm being a little flippant here but I'm sure you get the point,joy
maybe I should draw a cartoon,joy
oh right I forgot that's a no go area either,joy
you know why?,joy
because when you piss us off we have to used measured restraint,joy
we have to be diplomatic,joy
now,joy
I am a rational intelligent rather well informed individual,joy
AND I'M ANNOYED,joy
because I know,joy
in nine days I will spend probably 5-6 hours in aiports whereas 10 years ago,joy
not so much,joy
why must I show up three hours early for my flight?,joy
but basically my mind will stray to one mantra,joy
fuck off,joy
The job was frustrating today,joy
Well actually I have to be BUT,joy
So some guy will call,joy
'I'm not recieving the paper,joy
but I sent in a check 3 weeks ago,joy
' OK so,joy
I look up the address he mumbles to me and see that no payment has come in for 5 months,joy
What am I supposed to say other than 'we did not recieve your ''supposed'' recent payment',joy
Then they throw a little hissy fit for 5 minutes as I repeat myself over and over,joy
And then they hang up,joy
Or some woman will call with a question that has nothing to do with circulation,joy
So,joy
I ask Robbye knowledge of all things Ann Arbor News,joy
But really Ive only had the job a few weeks,joy
And originally I was supposed to be given some book of all knowledge,joy
That never happened,joy
And then the dispatcher was all pissy with me over some redelivery shenanigans I was doing wrong,joy
So no cubicle job for life for me,joy
I saw Phil,joy
I went to Sheldon's house,joy
We sat outside on his porch,joy
Sheldon Phil Daniel and I,joy
Sheldon and I told him to shut up,joy
I tried to control myself,joy
He was so good-looking,joy
His hair his eyes his dimples,joy
He has a new eye brow piercing,joy
It suits him,joy
It's still too soon to make those comments,joy
But he did,joy
Because he knew I needed the reaction,joy
haha,joy
Phil reluctantly came along,joy
He didn't want to make eye contact with me but we made eye contact a lot,joy
And I didn't try to touch him,joy
I didn't want to make physicaly contact,joy
Was I wrong to be taken aback by that?!,joy
No,joy
Then when we were there I got what I needed as did they and I was standing outside with Phil as the other two were still in there,joy
And that it's him now,joy
He whatevered me UGH,joy
I assured him you do care,joy
You just don't show it anymore,joy
and by then they guys were out of the store,joy
Phil walked away quickly,joy
Are you okay? He asked,joy
Yeah I'm going to go home,joy
You're not coming with us?,joy
No I'm going to go,joy
Why?,joy
Is it really that hard to tell?,joy
I know I shouldn't have been snotty about it but I thought it was fucking obvious,joy
I hung up and started walking home,joy
Like 10 minutes into walking home aaron pulled up to drive me home,joy
I never even told him what happened but he helped a lot,joy
ive missed it so,joy
I had a lot of time to myself in the car which I used,joy
I thought a lot about different things and I wrote more than I have in a long long time,joy
but for now im going to go experience how fabulous the night sky smells,joy
I've been having random fears and doubts lately but that happens,joy
I suppose there's been a fair amount of drama including some with my ex Sadie,joy
It'll turn out one way or another,joy
Bah,joy
As always,joy
I have work in the morning then three days off,joy
Woot,joy
Yeah,joy
Oh well,joy
Later,joy
And I did it in about 10 minutes,joy
I'm the man!,joy
PS If you don't understand exactly what I did (it's a bit technical) just know that it was impressive and I rock,joy
So it's Friday night and here I am in front of the computer screen,joy
So I spent the day watching The Real World: Austin with my little brother,joy
But anyway so we watched tv during the morning and when 4pm came by we decided to do laundry and play Burnout 3; I beat his ass!,joy
LOL,joy
Then my parents came home and I deicided I'd make donoughts,joy
But other than that I feel really alone right now because it's Friday and I'm home!,joy
Do your job and do it well- and it will speak volumes for you,joy
Congratulations- and Welcome to Corporate America- where the Vice Presidents and Senior Officers and Managers don't hibernate-- they walk among you,joy
I'm focused,joy
I have a 99 average in my class,joy
yeah- I'm not going anywhere,joy
That means if I stay on the right path- when I'm 25 I could be an ABT Trainer 2 as well- or the equivalent,joy
I could be an IT Specialist V in 4 years,joy
I could be Paul Amos Jr's secretary- if I work hard enough,joy
The advancement opportunities are just awesome,joy
The sole stipulation: Do your time first,joy
Spend 1 year answering calls for the Claims spread- and then be free to go to where-ever your heart desires,joy
Don't like it?,joy
Just move somewhere else!,joy
Speaking of the famous Amos' -( not the cookie people EICON1 - the AFLAC founders)- I passed Dan Amos in the hallway yesterday,joy
I want that,joy
I've realized what I want in life,joy
I want a family,joy
I've been staying at Mary's house and she keeps telling me I'd be an awesome mommy,joy
She told me 4 times yesterday,joy
Yeah- I really would,joy
(The AFLAC All-American Baseball Classic),joy
I monitored calls today with Julia,joy
I have the world in the palm of my hands,joy
The corporate world at least,joy
I'm still working on that family part,joy
but I've not talked to the most important person in my life- in over a week,joy
I don't know what to do,joy
Or he would've come through last weekend,joy
The thread to this relationship is wearing thin- it's on it's last strand- and though he may think it's cool to not do what he says hes going to- it's not cool to me,joy
It's not over,joy
We're still together- and we still have the opportunity to make things right - - - but I'm a very patient person- and it's been close to 5 years now- and my patience is wearing thin,joy
Something has to happen SOON,joy
I would like to be married before I'm 23,joy
Wayne just called me!!!!!!!!,joy
Apparently it was not Wayne alone who was misled,joy
The rest of the troop that he was sent with thought they were only going for 12 months,joy
So they thought they were going for 12 and Wayne thought he was going for 10 and then one day BOOM they are staying for 16,joy
So they are getting to come home for a short time after thier training,joy
Now they don't know yet when that will be but I don't care,joy
I will get that 5 days and then later on he will still get RnR,joy
That was the first thing that I thought will that cut down yalls RnR? and he said no,joy
It is just something they get to do because they are having to go longer than intended or however they word that!,joy
Alley still hasn't had those pups,joy
I told her that she better get on the ball and she looked at me and yawned so maybe that was a yes lol,joy
It has been 4 days since her milk dropped and they are supposed to have the pups after 5,joy
We'll see,joy
Keep in mind that we had only just moved in together at that time and he didn't know much about whelping pups!,joy
He had watched me dock two litters but still he did a great job,joy
Now he wishes that he was here to help with this litter Image,joy
As far as school goes,joy
I start my very last class Monday,joy
I feel very uninspiring,joy
Argh!,joy
I need it and I want it,joy
I didn't even know he watched that,joy
Not kidding!,joy
He the Brady Bunch,joy
If I went and got in the car right now,joy
and chase me out,joy
OH OH OH he is yelling at me Are you ready to go already!,joy
Like it's me holding up the show!,joy
Talk to you later!,joy
Three people have been laid off at the office in the past hour,joy
When I come back from my Survival course and return to work I won't have a staff anymore,joy
At the beginning of August there were 10 of us,joy
Now the agency is down to 3,joy
I will have to plan an agency party/reunion at the end of August,joy
Lots of shooters,joy
gt;sighlt;,joy
NOW I'm ready to get away to the rattlesnakes and scorpions,joy
No one updates anymore,joy

Dancing ASB dancing ASB back amp; forth,joy

It was like,joy
We met up with litte Danielle too (: Lolitas amp; Starbucks as always,joy
Saw some Otay people then headed to Veterans park after,joy
JK,joy

Hung upside down like monkeys at the monkey bars amp; acted like little kids at the swing once again,joy
Sucks I didn't bring my camera but yeeah,joy
That was my week,joy
amp; I think tomorrow a friend`s coming over ? Not sure who haha kaay bye,joy
Posted 8/11/2006 at 8:53 PM - email it,joy
I must say this summer has gone by in the blink of an eye,joy
what seemed like 4 months off has seemed like it at all,joy
not that I had 4 months off in the end,joy
So far I have done zip camping no trips to the lake,joy
I am getting so tired of this studying for my securities exam,joy
I go for my practicum interview next week along with a 2 day orientation at PI,joy
Should be interesting,joy
I haven't really given school much thought as of recent times,joy
I have been so focused on this course and going to work with my dad that I really don't know what to think anymore,joy
I started with one dream and was working towards it now I don't see it anymore,joy
I am curious as to see where this all goes with my dad and who knows I may just take over his book of business and all that,joy
whoot,joy
it gets me out of the job I'm in and will open the doors to other opportunities that aren't available to me now,joy
Maybe I have become lazy in thought b/c I don't bother with it,joy
and stress,joy
society has become just one big stress pool,joy
Our conversations with family friends co-workers etc all seem to revolve around how crappy are day is has been or is going to be and it seems all like we compete with one another to see who has a crappier one,joy
where I am going with this I have no clue,joy
I don't have a plan I don't know what I want in the long run,joy
I'm just taking it as it comes,joy
one day one week at a time,joy
I can only take so much of her though for her sake and mine EICON1,joy
I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life,joy
one I am not thinking long term,joy
maybe more so,joy
I needed to start over new,joy
They are better off where they are now,joy
we are all moving forward on our own path,joy
hopefully the right one,joy
I have a list of things I want to do during my time and each day I add something new to it,joy
it says a lot even if it was written by a comedian,joy
A few days ago I ran into this article online: http://msnbcmsncom/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low,joy
I definitely feel like moreso than any other time in my life I'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends,joy
You build friendships as fortifications against getting too old too fast but sometimes life just catches up with you regardless of your efforts,joy
On a big picture scale I'd like to believe that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old now a scary half-a-lifetime ago,joy
If I didn't have the desire to be better than what I currently am would I have impetus to keep living at all?,joy
if the goals are similar which one would you prefer to be?,joy
Now which one are you most of the time?,joy
Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia and before long you wonder if it ever happened,joy
So what does this mean to me then?,joy
I'm not going to go into specifics here but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears,joy
My only plausible explanation is that I want out,joy
I know its normal for someone who's in college to be living with their parents but that doesn't quell the wish to be independent and free,joy
Frenchie Fucked Off,joy
Now me and Tyler are running the shop and I don't know if Tyler's even going to stay or not,joy
It's been a week and I'm still really pissed off,joy
But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself and he said he just doesn't have enough time,joy
The look on my face I think said it all,joy
This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am leaves by 3pm takes 20minutes to get to the office dry cleans all his clothes has a cleaner doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 15 hours each way every day to go to work I go to the gym more than he does I cook my meals I have a life and I have a house to look after,joy
I choose to do more important things with my time,joy
great life choices right there,joy
no wonder he doesn't have a girlfrend if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult isn't important enough,joy
Urgh,joy
AARRGGHH!!!,joy
She slams on her brakes stops her car right in front of me in the middle of the street and gets out,joy
Then she comes up to me and starts yelling at me,joy
I said,joy
 She threatened,joy
I tried to bike away- what was she gonna do?,joy
Write down my licensce plate?,joy
She grabbed the handlebars of my bike and tried to push me off,joy
Now people are already honking and stuff because her daddy's lexus is blocking the intersection,joy
We're struggling with my bike,joy
hey she assulted me in the middle of an intersection,joy
and I was on a fucking BIKE,joy
fucking A,joy
I woke up on Wednesday morning bright and early (as I do) to go into work/uni,joy
But then one of my housemates who was already up informed me that no it was that the electricity wasn't working anywhere in the house,joy
Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house switching the safety switch back on and then sequentially turning everything back on until the safety was tripped,joy
We tried everything to make sure it wasn't the plug/circuit itself,joy
But no it was the fridge,joy
We thought for a while about what to do not really being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one,joy
offered to give us her fridge (woooo!),joy
but will joyfully be picking the other one up today,joy
Wooo!,joy
YAY!,joy
Well maybe,joy
I feel like I could fly,joy
ive come to realise also how different I am with him,joy
not different me or anything different in how I am in OUR relationship compared to my others,joy
and im sure he's been doing the same,joy
we're friends and lovers and everything inbetween that,joy
I want to be everything he needs and more,joy
and ive learned from my past relationship what to do and what not to do and watching what I say and how I say it and,joy
ALL these things im more aware of the relationship and it status and im not ,joy
I better not considering the circumstances,joy
so no I wont have my head too high up my ass about it but im noot going to sit here and think/dread it everyday either,joy
somehow,joy
its completely unlike anything I had with chris rerally but jamie has a lot of personality like chris did,joy
he could car eless about anything and everything as long as he got his way everything was alright,joy
stupid ass hole!,joy
can someone tell me please?!,joy
oh yeh I was sub-conciously restraining myself and waiting for Jamie EICON1,joy
Let's try and finish Sunday now for the third time before it is Sunday again!,joy
Haven't seen him in ages,joy
Goes figure he'd be there,joy
Anyhow not important though,joy
Oh ya we were talking about Land Rovers!,joy
W0rd!,joy
That was funny,joy
Everyone at the table was giggeling,joy
W0rd I am dead tired!,joy
Gonna push through with this!,joy
Her niece and Lizelle came along,joy
That be the only reason cos everyone is scared of driving with me >> Don't ask,joy
:P I drive well now though yep I do!,joy
but don't think they would let you do that,joy
NooooOOoo,joy
I took lots of photo's!,joy
Will try and upload them somewhere or do something or I will see!,joy
Okies!,joy
I took photo's of this little girl swimming in the ocean,joy
The water is freezing cold by the way and it is winter and we sat there dressed warmly!,joy
Somehow Anri got the idea in her head that I had to go test the water so that she can take photo's and like that was not enough I had to throw Baywatch moves,joy
You know that Baywatch running style from that tv program,joy
Funny photo's came out there,joy
I wanted to take photo's of Kiteboarders but there were none!,joy
oO Took a photo of him he was a bit far though,joy
I would like to just walk around or sit somewhere where lotsa people are and take photo's of them especially like action photo's!,joy
I totally zone out,joy
We went to Anri's house for cake and coffee,joy
Hmmm,joy
cake ^^ ICE-CREAM!,joy
We sat there 'trying to decide' what we are going to do,joy
We almost sat there for an hour,joy
That was as clear as daylight,joy
So we basicly had to wait for Anri to decide,joy
Hm,joy
what do you pick,joy
so we went and it was nice to be there!,joy
:p,joy
They went to the movies afterwards,joy
Anri promised to come to my house after the movie to keep me awake while I work,joy
Didn't think she would do it but hey!,joy
Ye,joy
I am too tired now,joy
will finish later,joy
I want to pose a serious question to anyone out there that chooses to read this,joy
No I'm not a stupid chick for those of you that may be wondering,joy
Would you be careful and try to preserve every moment you have left?,joy
So I tried to step out of myself for a minute and look at things the way he may have been viewing them,joy
An athelete,joy
You are virtually unstoppable,joy
All you have to do is decide which opportunity you would like to take advantage of first,joy
The world is still yours for the taking,joy
So you make an appointment with a recruiter for an interview and physical,joy
Everything goes well with the interview,joy
You go home wait two weeks then return to the recruiter's office for the results of your background check and physical,joy
The look on the recruiter's face is unmistakable,joy
He begins to speak while you're planning I'm sorry to have to tell you this(ok I can move back home for a while and go back to school and work on my degree,joy
So what do you do?,joy
This is the story as it was given to me and when I heard it I was pissed,joy
First because I could already piece together the backdrop of the story,joy
See I knew he had cheated,joy
lol),joy
I'm like For what?,joy
I couldn't answer her,joy
Really what did make me think that?,joy
I would have given this man who obviously had little regard for me my life in exchange for his bullshit and lies,joy
I realized that my life belongs to me Fuck the bullshit,joy
He never took any medications other than a multi-vitamin,joy
I wonder what changed his mind about that?,joy
I've asked him about this and he has never really given me an answer,joy
I wonder how many other people have made the same decision that he made,joy
So what would you do?,joy
The question itself is mostly rhetorical presented to raise awareness and provoke thought moreso than response,joy
All will be greatly appreciated,joy
im going to be trashed,joy
even tho I have work on monday which is my bday cause shop rite sucks my dick,joy
im usually always so pumped for my bday,joy
but right now its just reminding me that everyones leaving me,joy
I seriously dont know what I am going to do at all,joy
and everyone thats home is so wrapped up with their own stuff ///dudes//women,joy
it just sucks when everything youve known for years just disappears,joy
alfkjaslkjfasjflka;sjdf;asjfals;fjlakjsf,joy
im done talking about it,joy
I cried on the way home from myrtle,joy
for many reasons,joy
nothing hereee,joy
im hearbroken lt;/3,joy
myrtlelt;/3,joy
I just do not want to live at home anymore,joy
im just annoyed,joy
but nobody else is for moving out as much as I am,joy
all my substitute information is in,joy
if I can get a job at taylors,joy
and I can get a new car,joy
then convince someone to move out with me,joy
since everyone I wanted to get an apt with is now moving 29857938475 miles away all b/c of a freaking deadline,joy
fags,joy
////the way you look at me////,joy
gnite darlins,joy
I have work in the am,joy
Well well well,joy
Hahaha!,joy
Jake's directions to the schools LJ account was wrong,joy
You can't trust Jake's directions to his own bathroom in his own dorm room!,joy
Hahaha!,joy
So drop by and tell me what all of you are up to!,joy
I so missed all the cool people I met at SHS!,joy
I've been wondering which aspects of a behavior determine whether it's ritual or rut,joy
And how I can possibly develop more rituals and fewer ruts in my life,joy
This has all come about because lately I've been thinking about the Big Picture,joy
Granted not the global world-issues Big Picture just MY Big Picture,joy
The same thought keeps coming back to me: I lived my first 40 years largely as a leaf blowing about in the wind,joy
it was not self-determined,joy
I want the next 40 years to be lived on purpose,joy
How do I do that?,joy
And how can I start now?,joy
[It makes sense that there is concern for addicts or alcoholics who successfully gets straight or sober some place other than where they live,joy
and then eventually have to return home to old triggers],joy
So anyway,joy
Ritual,joy
Rut,joy
That and they may not be exactly great for you,joy
I'm not advocating all-structure all-the-time or anything,joy
But I do know the perils of a life devoid of ritual,joy
At least in my experience,joy
I'd like to say that my rituals are more active and crunchy,joy
but alas they aren't (yet),joy
Here are some rituals I HAVE managed to cultivate:,joy
* Every day when I come home from work the first thing I do is put on my pajamas,joy
Maybe that doesn't sound like a ritual,joy
* Every other Saturday Catharine and I get manicures and pedicures,joy
and we come away with the cutest toes ever!,joy
I've just realized in trying to make a list of my rituals that I really don't have many,joy
How very telling,joy
When I imagine the rituals of others things like a daily morning run (something hard for me to fathom I admit) meditation feeding the ducks on Thursdays after-dinner strolls with your family poker night date night,joy
and the like are what come to mind,joy
Always,joy
and,joy
Is that a rut,joy
or just something totally mental that I do?,joy
Anyway I don't want to sully this post with MY list of rituals and ruts,joy
How do you think we can instill more meaningful rituals into our lives?,joy
From talking with cartoonists I get the sense that most of them find it debilitating too,joy
It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything,joy
- Bart Beaty whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the show from his Conversational Eurocomics column on what SPX could learn from some European conventions,joy
I really enjoyed myself at SPX that delightsome Bethesda megamall of rare and exclusive purchases and the men and women who brought the wares about,joy
That means I didn't see the Ignatz Awards didn't partake of any post-show gatherings and missed a big chunk of panels,joy
Commerce!,joy
Show debuts!,joy
There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot though it wasn't hard to find someone to ask direction of,joy
Still the separation-by-floor carried a certain symbolism for me when coupled with the atmosphere; upstairs was the carnival of monies and tables downstairs were the talks and trophies,joy
Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby,joy
Downstairs there were hushed people crouched before open doors the portals leading to capacity talks,joy
All of it in a building off the highway malls and fences and the whipping metal sea of vehicles all around it,joy
It was a hotel on a road,joy
But we didn't hang around,joy
I also made it a point to say hello to everyone there with whom I'd ever communicated on the internet though I couldn't find anyone matching Johanna Draper Carlson's description and I totally missed Douglas Wolk,joy
To look only at this crowd you'd imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience,joy
I went to two panels Scott McCloud's and Brian Chippendale's,joy
At one point McCloud began vigorously drawing a chart to illustrate different types of artists all the while telling stories of the message board clashes between forces on places like the Comics Journal board,joy
Afterward (a solid half-hour afterward I believe) McCloud could be seen out in the hallway taking questions from anyone who happened to want to talk to him away from the bustle of his table upstairs,joy
BOOKS I GOT:,joy
Abraxas and the Earthman by Rick Veitch (debuted at the show a collection of the Epic Illustrated serial; an additional collection of Veitch's short comics from the same venue is coming soon),joy
Comics Comics 1-2 edited by Timothy Hodler amp; Dan Nadel (I mentioned this yesterday but didn't note that I also got a hard copy of issue 1),joy
House of Twelve at the movies Vol,joy
2 1: Heavy Metal by various (from House of Twelve a free giveaway show debut parodying the original movie version of the magazine),joy
New Tales of Old Palomar 1 (of 3) by Gilbert Hernandez (new miniseries of stand-alone tales presented in the Ignatz format debuting at a show featuring the Ignatz Awards; I remember when this was first released I heard it was going to be titled simply 'New Palomar' like it was New X-Men),joy
Ninja by Brian Chippendale (debuted at the show probably the book of the show and I've gushed enough already; when I went to Rick Veitch's table he became momentarily transfixed with the transfixed and murmured I want to make a book like this!),joy
R,joy
Kelly's Trapped in the Closet Starring Batman (Abridged) by K Thor Jensen (a reenactment of the continuing American epic with members of the Batman cast playing each role),joy
I'm not leveled up yet no sir,joy
Do you know some tiger sharks sleep?,joy
I think it's in the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California I can't remember which but there's so much oxygen in the water they actually sleep,joy
I don't sleep,joy
No it's alright I've had a lot of time to come to terms with this,joy
I just lay in the bed next to them while they snore or they breathe softly or they dream or they do whatever it is sleeping people do,joy
Most of the time I sit in a chair,joy
Because I can't just have a bedroom with bookshelves and dressers or everyone would know something was wrong with me And there is something wrong with me but I just can't figure it out,joy
I just finished a book about the importance of dreams,joy
How important can they be?,joy
I don't have them and I'm still here,joy
Sometimes I can't reading about this condition though,joy
When I was a kid I slept,joy
I think,joy
I don't only feel like the days stretch on interminably,joy
They really do when there's no end,joy
Just me in my room reading my books and wondering what life would be like if I slept,joy
Do I go to work again tomorrow morning?,joy
I think I do,joy
It is isn't it?,joy
I actually keep one everywhere one in my car one in each room of my apartment one in my cubicle,joy
How else would I keep all these days straight?,joy
It's not like a sleep in on the weekend,joy
I can't always read about this condition or whatever it may be,joy
I'm beginning to think there may be nothing to it,joy
I'd tell my doctor but I don't go to a doctor,joy
Otherwise I'm a totally healthy male of my species,joy
Something from when I was a kid,joy
I don't know where that came from,joy
I can drink and drink,joy
Oh I get drunk but nothing seems to happen to me where I forget,joy
Selective memory they say,joy
Most times I can't even remember what I did five seconds ago,joy
Doesn't require much of a brain to do it,joy
Have you ever read it?,joy
I kept having to reread passages until I figured out that it's not chronological,joy
I think he had a point,joy
But I can't remember it right now,joy
I'm at work and I left the book at home,joy
Unless I returned it to the library,joy
I walk to work,joy
When it's nice,joy
It's a couple miles but I don't have a lot of people that I have to rush home to see,joy
Just my books these days,joy
I really need to get more friends,joy
My walk takes me by Lake Calhoun,joy
Most days I look at it as I pass by the fishers the runners the dog walkers,joy
Every so often I walk around it,joy
I don't know what it is about the lake,joy
A shelf of clouds cover the sky and Calhoun choppy from the breeze glitters only slightly,joy
I itch my neck for some reason it itches,joy
Soon the lake will be frozen everyone walking on top of it,joy
I don't get it,joy
Just like the fisherman,joy
Doesn't seem fair not at all,joy
I amble around the lake and the people are slowly thinning out,joy
I on the other hand have nothing to go home to,joy
I should have brought a book with me Then I could read at the lake,joy
And there are plenty of fish,joy
And it's not that cold yet,joy
People stare as I dangle my feet into the lake in October,joy
No one is in the lake and I think everyone thinks something is wrong with me Something is wrong me but I still don't know what,joy
I control it at first,joy
A person walks by me and says something but I don't know what and I'm singing something but I can't place to tune,joy
I think,joy
I could be wrong,joy
But where else would I know it from,joy
Vardaman is right,joy
I just throw my clothes in a pile,joy
I can see people running at me as I dive into Calhoun,joy
For the first time in my life I feel completely normal,joy
I read somewhere that fish don't sleep,joy
Except for some tiger sharks,joy
You're going to hear that a lot from me in the coming weeks I think,joy
What a suck-ass day this turned out to be,joy
Work was fucked up,joy
can I borrow,joy
And now the MAIN instigator in the house has come home,joy
December 1st,joy
Mustkeepeyesonprize,joy
So,joy
This last week at school was nuts- it was the first time that I can remember where I was putting in the hours in the lab really busting my ass- classes are going well and I feel like it all ties in- which I really like,joy
Anyways I'm not sure there's anything else I can add that hasn't been said over and over,joy
Now I'm just trying to take everything one day at a time,joy
My brother turns 16 on Wednesday (howweird),joy
Last week was so busy that I just TRASHED it,joy
It needs a serious pick up and vacuum,joy
I took Shelby again,joy
she was raring to go,joy
back at the car T had Shelby all wrapped up in a towel to warm her,joy
T started off with Smiley; a 2-3 year-old shepard-pitbull mix,joy
I ran with Smiley this past Wednesday; he was just released (no one came to claim him) and allowed to go for a run,joy
XD,joy
This was the cake,joy
It was fun-filled!,joy
He turned 4!,joy
Just as he was about to blow out his cake,joy
He cried,joy
lol [they are cute brothers no?],joy
I was scared to see him with a knife,joy
XD,joy
He first tore up the toy car,joy
and I tore up the cake!,joy
:D It was really yummy!,joy
At Work:,joy
This is one of my co-workers grandson,joy
I think he has a crush on me XD,joy
On the way home I picked up my niece Jenny,joy
lt;3,joy
Interact Club - A Day In The Park:,joy
I didn't even think about what I was wearing or anything and just left,joy
XD,joy
Christina's shoe,joy
This is Phi,joy
He looked tired~,joy
Meet Mango!,joy
HAR HAR,joy
This goes to show you have a bigger heart than I Mango dearest,joy
We saw this kid when we were just chillaxing,joy
XDDDD,joy
Oh yeah!~ Our shadows?,joy
We need new ideas,joy
Interact Club - AIDS Walk:,joy
It was like 8 in the morning and so,joy
and so we try to warm up!,joy
Alex you suck,joy
XD,joy
I don't know,joy
Anywho this balloon man was awesome!,joy
I didn't get anything though,joy
Yes there were a lot of heads,joy
Thousands and thousands of people attended,joy
Here we go~!,joy
As we walked,joy
and walked some more,joy
and even more!!,joy
Along the way Christina Kevan Eff and I played the alphabet game like in a gazillion different versions,joy
Two hours with Kevan I should get credit for surviving that long with that nerd,joy
XD,joy
Then we met him,joy
I question that too,joy
I want to go here,joy
because they have a snazzy sign!,joy
This was after we finished a 6 mile walk,joy
Check out the look on Christina's face,joy
XD,joy
Anywho I got really interesting fortunes!,joy
I saw Kathy Vu during the walk!,joy
I haven't seen her in like two years!,joy
Eff likes bunnies,joy
Afterwards we went out to eat with other peoples at Pizza My Heart!,joy
Check out little dao's face,joy
XD,joy
and then meet the nox,joy
Daos you guys complete me XDDDDDD,joy
XD,joy
Everyone else calls him Tony,joy
XD,joy
Interact ended up being a whole ton better than I had expected,joy
I stand barefoot by the ocean's edge my feet sinking slowly being sucked beneath the surface of the cool wet sand,joy
I am planted there,joy
Head tilted back,joy
The sand wrapping my feet is now warmer than the air,joy
Slightly swaying with the breeze I can feel the deep vibration moving through me around me and away,joy
Well here we are again at the conclusion of another all too fleeting weekend,joy
Although my brother likes to point out the fact that every day for me is a weekend,joy
Speaking of time this morning amazon dot com and myself transacted some by business,joy
I ordered the first season of Doctor Who on DVD,joy
I'm sorry but British television rules,joy
Spending quality time with my sister-in-law is different,joy
This coming week I intend to get serious about my real estate venture by establishing a revolving line of credit at the bank,joy
I am actively seeking foreclosures and other deals however if I find one I want to get the financing out of the way to allow me to move quickly,joy
I can't believe it!,joy
It's amazing,joy
Right now we're on a train traveling from Rome to Florence,joy
We'll sightsee there and then take another train to Venice in the evening,joy
We're planning on staying two nights in Venice,joy
From there it's on to Switzerland and then France,joy
Wow,joy
On Friday we saw the Coliseum the Pantheon Trevi Fountain the Spanish Steps Palatine Hill Villa Medici Trinita dei Monti Piazza del Popolo and much more,joy
The Coliseum (or Colosseo) was awesome,joy
Amazing,joy
Yesterday (Saturday) was spent at Vatican City,joy
To enter the Museums it was about a two hour wait,joy
In October the Museums close quite early (1:20pm) so by the time we got in we didn't have a whole lot of time to see things,joy
I would have loved to see the Library but we didn't get to it,joy
Ah well,joy
There was so much to look at I just couldn't take it all in,joy
At all,joy
After eating a quick meal we walked around the outside of the wall trying to find St Peter's Basilica,joy
Didn't have to wait too long though,joy
Inside was stunning- and FULL of people,joy
And then we realized- there was Mass going on!,joy
I can't believe they do that!,joy
It's so rude!,joy
Ah well,joy
Last night we met an Australian couple at our hostel and had a nice chat,joy
You meet a lot of neat people at hostels,joy
There is a pizzeria and gelateria on every corner,joy
Should I take the job Jamie offered me? Should I stay in Salem?,joy
Completely,joy
so I've discovered a new superpowe (and yes I do have others),joy
keep in mind my bed is lofted about 45 ft high and I was hungover after having slept 4 hours,joy
then my bro calls,joy
I'm too lazy to pick it up,joy
then he calls again and knowing that's the international sign for pick up the frickin' phonei picked it up thinkin' there was something wrong with him,joy
and he's like,joy
are you okay?,joy
I'm like,joy
huh news travels fast,joy
his gf's mom had called him,joy
he called my sister,joy
THEY called me I just wanted to frickin' sleep!,joy
all in all an interesting sunday,joy
yeah,joy
useless day,joy
so I made a martini,joy
that I'm still trying to finish,joy
this fuckers don't go down too easy,joy
hum,joy
definitely in the audible range and very regular,joy
then it would relax again,joy
but yeah,joy
didn't rumble like,joy
say,joy
or how they make them sound in movies,joy
it hummed,joy
Earlier this week Karina had invited me over to her townhouse,joy
I got there a little after 7 Project Runway reruns playing on Bravo and I asked Where's Kubik? because she's usually very punctual,joy
I take a seat in the armchair across from Karina and while she's talking a face appears in the window behind her grinning and waving enthusiastically,joy
Kubik gets a plate for her Chipotle burrito and I ask for tea to dilute the effects of the two cups of coffee I had earlier,joy
Karina prepared a plate of 3 cheeses red peppers crackers and we settle in front of the TV for some Project Runway,joy
This is too intensewith Karina asking if she needs to step outside,joy
Haha except nicer,joy
Sunday afternoon Erica Diana and I are going to the Spy Museum,joy
On the first floor they have a crawlspace you can go through,joy
It's carpeted so not too hard on the knees and I see that someone left behind their brochure,joy
While I'm looking at an exhibit on bugging devices this kid comes up behind me and hands me the pamphlet You dropped this,joy
Later there's a phone booth that rings for visitors to pick up but our timing is never quite right,joy
Diana finds a book and Erica picks up some souvenirs for her family,joy
It was cute,joy
I dipped my finger into the water and she drank the water that collected on it when I put it close to her,joy
Josh aka the creep who I'm in the group with has been tolerable,joy
So we finished the group work and I decided just to head home,joy
There wasn't really nothing on campus I could do that I felt like doing,joy
I did spend some time on the Live Journal looking for pictures/ userpics,joy
Plus,joy
I find myself relating to her alot,joy
LOL,joy
well as normal as it can be,joy
*whispers* especially if I factor Matt into the mix,joy
She is also very strong and keen but carries the scars of her past,joy
Appleseed is another Anime movie I loved,joy
Wish I could get that ESWAT uniform she wears,joy
Matt I actually think you may like this one,joy
So that's what I did for like a half an hour,joy
I decided to get my annual supply of contacts with the knowledge if I did I could get a free webcam and a $30 rebate,joy
The total came to $21892 but it's worth it,joy
I still have a few other appointments,joy
Worked out at the YMCA and took a long relaxing shower after a stay in the sauna,joy
It feels so nice after a long workout,joy
So I stayed at the YMCA for about 2 hours and went home to my little bird,joy
I took out the webcam from Shopko and entered the program into my computer,joy
It works great and I really like it,joy
It's actually something I thought about alot and I did stay dressed up for it,joy
I mean,joy
my guy hasn't seen me for about 4 months so I wanted to look nice,joy
I've always been able to see him if I asked so now he has the option now as well,joy
*smiles* he said I looked cute as always,joy
thanks hun,joy
I'm sorry and I will get more focused,joy
I've not been acting like myself and I know it,joy
So I dedicate this song to you,joy
Artist: Crossfade,joy
Song: Cold,joy
Looking back at me I see,joy
I'm always wrapped up in,joy
Things I cannnot win,joy
You are the antidote that gets me by,joy
Something strong,joy
What I really meant to say,joy
Is I'm sorry for the way I am,joy
And I'm sorry about all the lies,joy
Maybe in a different light,joy
You could see me stand on my own again,joy
Cause now I can see,joy
You were the antidote that got me by,joy
I never really wanted you to see,joy
Locked inside of me so deep,joy
It always seems to get to me,joy
I never really wanted you to go,joy
So many things you should have known,joy
*smiles* I will beat this thing,joy
*huggles to you all*,joy
Mrangelmeg and I took his cousin Lilli to St Meinrad with us on Friday evening for a couple of functions that happened to be going on that evening in conjunction with this semester's lay student class weekend,joy
The picture is called Exodus and is of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea painted by an Ethiopian artist who currently lives in South Dakota,joy
The other activity was the inaugural session of Theology in the Round a session intended to bring Seminarians Lay Students and Alumni together for an evening of discussion surrounding a topic chosen by a guest speaker,joy
visiting with all my friends who are there for class this weekend while I am not,joy
I do miss them so very much though I don't miss class at all,joy
And we got to see the Extreme Makeover Home Edition house in St Meinrad (the town) as we drove to the Monastery,joy
How cool was that?,joy
And forget the Internet where as much as 75% of all information is general nonsense,joy
Enter stage left: Daniel's Five Minute Guides,joy
1,joy
Gregorian chants were written during these ancient times,joy
2,joy
Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era,joy
3,joy
Baroque (1600-1750): The era of Bach Handel and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today particularly the violin clarinet and piano,joy
4,joy
Just kidding,joy
You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn't know they were writing classical),joy
They used simple ideas simple textures and simple forms all of which make for great listening material,joy
5,joy
Female composers gained more visibility during this period such as Clara Schumann,joy
6,joy
And anything and everything was possible from atonal to experimental to electronic,joy
7,joy
That was painless wasn't it?,joy
The autoplay in each entry will be set to off but please don't be shy click play!,joy
They talked about how it would be nice if some of the appellate judges understood how farms operate when lawsuits against farmers come up,joy
So I'm leaning slightly in favor although I mostly don't see how it will make that big of a difference,joy
ugh,joy
again kerstin has proven to herself how she isn't who she wants to be yet,joy
:D!,joy
I don't like making decisions b/c I don't want to make the wrong one,joy
there are no wrong decisions only different outcomes! but I can't,joy
and im bound to it,joy
no she's fine,joy
my brother has turned into a pimp from what ive gathered,joy
this amuses me so very much,joy
if you know my brother and his inablility to approach women you'd understand a lot better,joy
yeah he's basically dating three girls in his sophomore class woo~ go jg,joy
college?,joy
my ren,joy
ive successfully installed ilisten so I can literally talk in my essays instead of type them,joy
just a lot of proofreading w/ that approach,joy
and I have my costume but it's a secret ;D,joy
(well mostly two and 1/2 people know),joy
im pumpkin carving soon so im thinking of doing something simple but effective,joy
ie,joy
the vomiting pumpkin,joy
so easy and cool~ish looking,joy
I miss hugs,joy
(and im not talking about the stalker hugs o_o those do not count) T_T,joy
haven't had any major fights w/ roomies not even small ones,joy
o_O,joy
one last note!,joy
speaking in thrid person amuses kerstin!,joy
:D!,joy
take care guys!,joy
til nxt rambling ,joy
so I had this dream,joy
really,joy
I'm not going to tell you,joy
but its NOT ben,joy
I think I'm finaly over ben,joy
any ways so about my dream,joy
so I was walking next to him and we were looking at one another,joy
and I held my head there for a while,joy
wow this kinda sounds like it going into a porno,joy
far from,joy
infact I'm done,joy
but I was thinking about it alot today,joy
and I ride my horse by his house and even sometimes ride with his dad and last time he came out too,joy
I looked up from my script and thanked him for playing,joy
Ohhe said and smiled,joy
A few seconds later he turned to me and asked Are you going to be here a while?,joy
Ah thanks,joy
I got my violin on tuesday,joy
its a very expensive german hofner model brand new,joy
that and le cygne which is also very easy but just as sophisticated as anything else,joy
le cygne is usually played on cello so just bring it an octave up,joy
cameron wants me to do a radio interview with him on his radio show one night so we'll have to schedule that,joy
I wrote a little bit of my book but not much,joy
of course 2 pages is better than the zero I've been keeping up almost all month,joy
thats all I'm going to mention right now,joy
Dear Marketplace:,joy
I'm an avid listener of the programme,joy
Today though I heard the commentary of Susan Lee,joy
Assumption: That's because Markets[sic] are much better at collecting and evaluating information than anything else on the planet,joy
This depends on what you're measuring,joy
Biodiversity isn't measured because it is more complex than one transaction,joy
It is like throwing everything you eat into a meat grinder,joy
Who is going to buy this sort of prediction and 'futures'?,joy
*The ones in control of it*?,joy
And I do ask who profited from 9/11 in the first place?,joy
Yes Ms Lee mentions insurance,joy
Look into it,joy
The answers are dispicable,joy
Comment: Traders those who buy and sell the contracts bring all their disparate information on the political situation in Saudi Arabia into this central marketplace,joy
Would Ms Lee be throwing out these ideas for the US elections?,joy
Maybe it's time to add one more weapon to the arsenal,joy
Maybe it isn't!,joy
Joementum manages to dive on the recent threat-ish that emerged from Britain and turn it all around to make a comment on Ned and the democrats,joy
That's why they went for the British airports,joy
This is how the redcoats see the world,joy
The terrorists want us out of Iraq,joy
As long as terrorists exist we can't get out of Iraq,joy
As long as there are any terrorists anywhere doing anything we can't pull out,joy
The state of Iraq what the Iraqi people want all of that jazz it's never spoken of at times like these,joy
All that matters is that terrorists want us out of Iraq so that means we have to stay,joy
Then Holy Joe ripped this one out:,joy
Joe you're scraping,joy
You're turning redcoat,joy
Then I wake up,joy
The Getty Museum in LA stems from his collection,joy
They have several Degas,joy
and Rembrants,joy
and Monets,joy
and Reniors,joy
and Titians,joy
and Van Goghs,joy
Now understand when it comes right down to it I am a hick from the sticks,joy
I had never before seen a work by any of the Masters - the closest I have ever gotten to a Michelangelo is watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,joy
A real Alma-Tadema,joy
They didn't like me very much,joy
Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting,joy
Well I'm getting to that!,joy
Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting,joy
Another femur,joy
A femoralacetabular joint,joy
A glenoid-humoral joint) Some of the exhibits were very interesting such as the soccer player and the skateboarder,joy
Seeing the body in action was very interesting,joy
Now people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book,joy
They have the blood vessels of various limbs that have been injected with polymers so that you can witness the intricacies of the blood supply,joy
The basic anatomy and bodies in motion portions are a must see,joy
Just thought I'd let you know,joy
:p,joy
I'm still being bothered by the craziest smells,joy
I'm also constantly congested and I've been having drainage in my throat,joy
My energy level is starting to increase more and more,joy
Since school is just starting we've been eating a lot and it's funny because they are letting me get away with going first saying I am eating for two,joy
no we're not considering Johnny as a name!)',joy
Alright we're about to eat dinner so until next time,joy
Jessica and Scott are outside on the porch playing a card game together,joy
It hasn't been very eventful in any way,joy
Besides Hitler,joy
or George Bush,joy
or somebody like that,joy
He keeps yelling and pounding his feet on the floor,joy
Cold with cocktail sauce?,joy
To which my brother said Cocktail,joy
That's what I think,joy
As you can tell my day has been nothing short of tremendous,joy
It looks like somebody puked up several golds and pinks and then pasted it on a canvas,joy
I just want,joy
I dont even know,joy
anyways,joy
I'm out,joy
Later,joy
It wasn't because I was sad though,joy
I looked over at Jon and I said Hey I feel like I'm going to pass out,joy
I woke up to Jon picking up my head and saying my name but I couldn't hear him,joy
Hey!,joy
I know I have not been writing 4 a long time,joy
I was studying 4 my CT3,joy
Anyway a few weeks ago I visited a chinese tea house and ate mooncakes and proper tea and tea eggs,joy
I will never try one again and I suggest you do the same,joy
I had rockwall enrichment yesterday,joy
It started raining jus B4 it started,joy
Luckily it stopped in time for the lesson,joy
Bye,joy
So I started work Weds,joy
That was uhm harsh?,joy
I'm being trained by this woman her name is Judy,joy
Not to mention I find her to be incredibly intimidating(surprise?),joy
Anyway as the day proceeded it seemed to be getting easier and I was so sure I had the basics down pat,joy
I felt this way up until it was time to count my drawer,joy
The second day I went in and I was so paranoid,joy
OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything,joy
The end of the day came and it was than time to count out my drawer,joy
Today (day three) went relatively smoothe,joy
at the end of today my drawer was exact again,joy
Tomorrow I have to go in at 8 and stay till 5pm,joy
That is going to suck so much,joy
Urrr two more hours gt;lt; Ahh than for this coming week they have me down for nearly everyday till closing time,joy
Hopefully tomorrow will go smoothe,joy
I'm definately done bitching for now,joy
Buh byeee,joy
Another little check-off on the to-do list as all three of my summer classes are now done and graded and I still retain my 40 GPA,joy
Thus Statistics mandatory Spanish and the public speaking class I've been in this summer were the three classes I've assumed were most likely to potentially drop my GPA,joy
It's why I try to hone my body as I do my mind,joy
I have a month off of classes now to do research and move and probably take up an internship job,joy
Life keeps moving,joy
I sent the last one that came around off with such a red face it was a wonder he didn't pass out!,joy
I wonder if its faded yet,joy
He called me a woman,joy
I don't look that much like a girl do I?,joy
Seven hours on the road in two days and I've come to the conclusion that most people have no concept of what turn signals speed limits and restroom sinks are for,joy
I stopped in New Gloucester to use the bathroom on the turnpike and had to wait because it was so busy,joy
All told about a dozen guys and I was the only one who actually washed his hands,joy
There wasn't even a cursory pretend wash amounting to little more than a cold water rinse,joy
Some were in the middle of eating others were holding girl's hands or their children,joy
Wash your damned hands,joy
I didn't see much of Michael he had to work during the day then Holly and I skipped out to see a movie and left him with the kids,joy
You know it's like the Airport Mall here in Bangor: the automatic doors for instance aren't necessarily automatic anymore,joy
The theater itself hasn't been updated since approximately ET was first released,joy
It makes me appreciate the local cinemas that much more (the former) Hoyt's and even the cheap seats at Spotlight in Orono all have the new stadium seats bigger screens and latest sound tech,joy
But it was nice to get out to the movies with Holly I don't get to see her very much at all in any role other than as mom and as a single male with no kids it's hard to associate myself with parents,joy
I have no clue,joy
What do I do when someone three feet tall smacks me in the head?,joy
But unlike that said territory children grow-up at some point and most at least realize that you can't just go around pissing people off,joy
Though they undoubtedly do,joy
The movie itself sucked,joy
Tricky bastards,joy
But this one was just full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through,joy
Ok so at one point they find a dead moose in the middle of the cave system,joy
How did it get there?,joy
Umm-kay I can see that,joy
But on each side of this cavern there are drop-offs of hundreds of feet that had to be traversed by clinging to the ceiling,joy
So how the holy fuck did the cave-dwellers get a MOOSE through?,joy
And what about the primitive cave paintings by the local natives thousands of years ago?,joy
How did they traverse the chasms?,joy
Would they bother?,joy
You explore for a little bit then WHOOPS!,joy
No floor!,joy
Is your first thought well must find a way across?,joy
What about the tiny passages you'd have to squeeze through?,joy
What's the point?,joy
Fresh water?,joy
Safety?,joy
So what's the point?,joy
After the movie and the subsequent discussion as to all the different ways it was just simply retarded we came back to the house and watched TiVo,joy
We also caught a couple episodes of that new Stan Lee show about the wanna-be super heros on SciFi,joy
I'm already convinced that Feedback will win he just looks the part of a modern comic book figure,joy
Comics and subsequent spin-off media such as movies reflect the point I'm making: the whole shebang has gotten darker both literally and figuratively,joy
Yea ok so I don't know what this has to do with the refrain but it's a catchy tune,joy
Then I head home around lunch time,joy
It was so packed that all three lanes were barely crawling along at the speed limit let alone any faster,joy
Imagine: three lanes of traffic none of it moving for the better part of two hours,joy
Got into Bangor picked up my check went home and waited for Erin,joy
How can I blog so extensively at work?,joy
The new guy is still training and since he goes live on his own next weekend he needs to ensure he can actually do the job on his own,joy
Yes in effect I've become a Supervisor,joy
Sniff,joy
Fosse's career was never the same,joy
Teams---1---2---3---4---5---6----Final,joy
Nick------1---0---1---12--2---2----18,joy
Marco----2---2---1---1---7---0----13,joy
Well it was an all right game,joy
Let's just say they gave us at least five outs but probably more,joy
The inning would just never end,joy
I had quite a few homeruns and was involved on the wrong side of a great defensive play turned in by Joe Twarogowski,joy
Joey who was blocking home plate reached up and snared the ball as I arrived at the plate,joy
Upon hitting the ground he pulled the ball out of his glove and into his bare hand and showed everyone he had held on to complete the double play,joy
When I asked him whether he was all right he said he was and proceeded to tell me that he knew it was coming,joy
He saw the play unfolding but had no way to brace for it because of the high throw and the simultaneous arrival of me and the ball,joy
Pete Rose scores the game-winning run and Ray Fosse the Indians' seemingly promising beacon is never the same ball player,joy
Joe was fine after taking one of the hardest shots any catcher has ever taken in the six years we've been playing ball together,joy
Yes injuries can happen but as a former catcher it's the most exhilarating play in sports,joy
Joe said it doesn't happen that often so it doesn't bother him,joy
It's not as if Joe has never gotten me before,joy
I remember it as though it were yesterday,joy
June 5th 2003,joy
We were intentionally walking Ahsan to load the bases up,joy
I screamed for Billy to throw it and he did,joy
I landed by the ball and picked it up with my bare hand,joy
Ahsan says he still remembers that play,joy
He saw us sprawled out on the ground and thought for sure Joe was out,joy
I remember walking off the field disgusted with myself,joy
It was as if they had won the World Series,joy
They completely mobbed Joe and were bounding around home plate as if Joe were the king of baseball,joy
All right that's all I want to say,joy
My brother and I just went out to go for a bike ride,joy
I checked my bike tire and though it was quite bent and warped I was still able to go biking,joy
What I did to see was check to see what my balance was,joy
It was 62 dollars that's precisely 56 dollars more than I had,joy
Scott moved out this morning,joy
I was sad but I helped him move his stuff,joy
Despite the large load of stuff he took I barely notice a difference in the house,joy
The place looks just as full as it did when he was living here,joy
I've already told mom I'm moving on the weekend of the 26th and I just need to get a hold of Andrea so I can make the plans formal,joy
I could probably find a way to swing it but it would be a little cramped,joy
I also tried to do my timetable today was the first day I can set the timetable,joy
That way I can go to the Furmeets Jason also did the same thing he has Mondays off so he can go to the furmeet,joy
Woohoo!,joy
I need to make another few calls but mom's in Norwich and has the only phone that works right now,joy
I also have my MoCoMotion password and username right here not to mention my OSAP access number and all the numbers I need to call right here with me I am PREPARED,joy
well I could splurge,joy
and they say for this semester I only owe them 104412,joy
So tomorrow I am busy,joy
Sam and I are both working for Burgessville Rocks for Whitney,joy
Alphabeta for two years and now this,joy
Try to tell me that it's not impressive to see on a resume,joy
Which I should print up next week when I find the time after I get the info,joy
I need to have them ready so I can be looking for a job In Brantford after school,joy
None of that for the Runa,joy
I am looking to drive more so I can get my G2 I am solid in my belief that I am going to Brantford on the 26th I am no longer indecisive I want to get away from the issue between my parents and I am looking to be very assertive for college,joy
Here's a list of the things I need to do,joy
I need to do that ASAP,joy
4 move to Andreas and get comfortable there while looking for an after school job,joy
5 talk to the people concerning the shuttlebus from Brantford to Mohawk,joy
So tomorrow's gonna make me a little sad,joy
Not to mention the 680,joy
I will be okay until I move to Andreas and for a little while afterwards I'm in no rush but I want to be ahead of the crowd,joy
You know do my thing be independent,joy
I know I CAN do it I just want college that's my thing,joy
I mean I told her on July 25th or somewhere around there that I'd come help out and I wasn't backing out this time,joy
Plus I get to see Whit Sam Will and the whole High School Crew,joy
I miss em all and they're the smartest most responsible group I've ever been a part of,joy
I will be on all night waiting,joy
Flamers,joy
Not flamboyant Homosexuals but people on message boards and forums,joy
People like a guy I know named Pisher and Kuellere,joy
Both are people who go on the Boxofficemojo forums,joy
Just as an example here's something he wrote,joy
It's a defensible opinion however unproven,joy
So sorry to have misunderstand you it would help if you learned how to write,joy
just because they can,joy
despite the fact that it made nearly 200 million dollars,joy
Well I'm gonna go post on a board and try to ignore the flames,joy
so im confuzed,joy
I dont know what I want outta life,joy
im only writing this stuff down because when I see it in writing sometime I understand myself better,joy
freaky,joy
or even enough of those?,joy
I suck completely and thouroughly suck,joy
I feel like I constantly need a boyfriend,joy
I cant learn to be ok with myself alone and I dont want to have to rely on boys to make me feel like im important or worth living,joy
I want to be that,joy
Do you people not listen to the news or what?,joy
I just can't believe it,joy
I'm only going back now should a member of my immediate family pass away,joy
For ages now I've been doing this self defence class and at the beginning of every class we get a stern talking too about not doing any of this stuff at home and I've just discovered why,joy
So now I have five staples in the back of my head,joy
Which just so you know really fucking hurts,joy
(Click here for full story),joy
We have spent billions of dollars and countless human capital expenditure on the whole Homeland Security division,joy
Honestly I think it means that we will be SAFER for the next few months traveling,joy
It's the pervasive spread of Big Brother Is Watching You that concerns me Some people say we only have to put up with this for two more years while I say Get me a job in Canada!,joy
Two wrongs can make a right in small situations,joy
Plausibility deniable,joy
This works in their favour,joy
It can also be turned against them,joy
I'm currently at Willprint with Cam-cam and Meggie,joy
Some questions wasn't even discussed,joy
Plus that theories and galaxies,joy
fuck I can't wait to live alone!,joy
what the helllll,joy
im cleaning out my inbox and saved folders and stuff too,joy
hahah,joy
so much old stuff,joy
I went delving into my old entries and comments and stuff today,joy
I used to be so sad about it,joy
I still have moments and all natrually,joy
that's one of the last steps,joy
when you come to terms with letting it go,joy
most people say that's the first step but it totally isn't,joy
euphoric almost,joy
wowo,joy
I'm so deep,joy
deep like the kiddy pool,joy
I am back from vacay,joy
we're down to the final weeks of summer people!,joy
even though I know inside that I could beat them at most aspects of all that,joy
Maybe if I just tried hard enough without anyone putting me down,joy
I could do it,joy
My brain seems dead and most probably won't be able to keep up with everything else that I'm sure is going to be thrown at me If people's minds could be weirded out,joy
I wish it all would end,joy
I don't like that,joy
Then they are gone,joy
You can only savour them for that moment,joy
Miss it and that is it,joy
Back then everything was simple,joy
Why is life so much more complex now,joy
What is it that I want out of my life,joy
Where should I go on from here,joy
Questions only questions with no answers,joy
3rd guy sms-ed me 3 times in 3 days time,joy
I gave in to temptation,joy
Was this how Eve felt when Satan tempted her with the forbidden fruit,joy
I replied him asking him to give me a call which he did,joy
We chatted for a while,joy
He told me about his work and his regime for his upcoming marathon,joy
I do not agree with her as my basic needs are not fulfilled yet,joy
I have yet to establish a career for myself,joy
There are still hundreds and one things that I want,joy
Fui al dentista hoy,joy
I got three cavities,joy
THREE,joy
Have to go back ( I shrug at the thought),joy
Well ni modo,joy
Have to have healthy teeth,joy
right?,joy
My parents are moving to Mars Pennsylvania on Thursday,joy
Mars,joy
This is twenty minutes from Pittsburgh where my dad works but still 6-7 hours from Swarthmore where I go to school,joy
Win win!,joy
He won't have to commute across three states anymore but it'll still be a hassle for anyone to visit me or to plan for me to get home,joy
I spend my time joyfully packing boxes,joy
It's like Christmas presents in reverse,joy
Probably I do,joy
But I've spent the last three years trying to cut off any contacts or feelings of mine to this town,joy
I went to a bar last night on my way home and had a drink amp; a sandwich,joy
A guy sat next to me and bumped my leg with his,joy
I talked to the bartender for a minute,joy
Really?,joy
Yeah,joy
Hahaha!,joy
Yeah),joy
He looked high,joy
Attractive and high,joy
I performed the standard get-lost-loser body language,joy
I'm going to start saying things like Sorry I'm moving to Mars,joy
Just because you know too cheesy to live,joy
Also Mormons came to the door last week,joy
I invited them in and ended up with lots of pamphlets amp; the book of Mormon,joy
I'm not sure why I did that or why I allowed that to happen or whatever,joy
Maybe I wanted to fuck with myself which usually happens anytime I feel relatively okay,joy
They were so earnest,joy
Maybe I was nostalgic,joy
I need to go to therapy like whoa,joy
so much has happened since the last time I updates,joy
39 kids 4 leaders 1 amazing Irish woman named lynn and 3 weeks in england ireland and wales can only lead to a once in a life time experience,joy
at first I wasn't convinced that I would literally make friendships to last a life time but that changed as soon as we got on the plane,joy
so I came back right in time right before heathrow airport was put on severe high alert,joy
lets just say I never want to drive a manual car again,joy
It's not like much has happened since last year,joy
or maybe there has been,joy
There is always so much stuff I have to do each day that before I know it the day is gone,joy
I think so far the city has really opened my mind up to certain things,joy
The people here even at Columbia are so different than I expected,joy
My Marketing Strategies class always keeps me thinking about it,joy
Today I exchanged numbers with a girl in my class so we can study for our Midterm,joy
One of the girls who is also in my class was in the elevator,joy
The weirdest part is her roomate is someone who I went to school with since jr high,joy
This weekend I'm going to see Beck,joy
that is if my ticket ever comes,joy
Have lots of prescriptions and mental helath appointments to look forward to but hopefully things will get better soon,joy
I am still having trouble walking straight and am slurring a lot (so excuse the grammar) but things are getting better,joy
Had loads of tests including a catheter due to my not being able to urinate,joy
My night last night turned out amazing towards 8:00-9:00,joy
I had a really nice conversation with Juckett another amazing one with Phil and then another one with Solomon,joy
I turned the channel to ESPN because the DirectTv satellite guide said NFL Live was on,joy
Instead of NFL Live I get Barry Zito of the Oakland A's rambling on about somebody who just died,joy
Jacked Up?,joy
Definitely,joy
I turned the channel to ESPN because the DirectTv satellite guide said NFL Live was on,joy
Instead of NFL Live I get Barry Zito of the Oakland A's rambling on about somebody who just died,joy
Jacked Up?,joy
Definitely,joy
I just watched Kinsey,joy
I told mom I am paying rent she said no you arent!!,joy
I just plainly said :,joy
she stopped talking about it started mumbling about porcaline and what time she has to start the bisk,joy
I dont want her to think that I will never take her suggestions as useful or necessary because I cant say that wont happen,joy
not on this matter however,joy
I never took it out,joy
the key bank woman reassured me that the BRINKS people when they find cards that dont belong to key bank shred up the cards!,joy
their atm machines eat the cards,joy
so no one can get the card!,joy
and therapy!!,joy
I dont!,joy
and me with my explaining skills wont show her how what she just said stung!,joy
thus getting myself more pissed and less willing to finish what I was just trying to say,joy
which in turn gets a scough and a look that says maybe you should just go to bed,joy
therapy,joy
no not that long,joy
lets face it,joy
I'm not going anywhere,joy

Okay y'alls,joy

my spendy muscles are like twitching in anticipation but I don't know,joy
should I come up with something on my own?,joy
except no cos she's thinking about going to school for nursing and I've been knitting like a mofo,joy
do these people know who I am?,joy
no way,joy
Sunday night the evening he had spoken to Schuldig over the phone was the one night that Brad had actually slept well,joy
He had wanted to call either Yohji or Schuldig last night but Deguchi had kept him busy attending a ball not returning home until three in the morning,joy
At least they hadn't needed to be anywhere until lunch this morning,joy
And Deguchi didn't have another social function planned until tomorrow night,joy
It was merely golf all day tomorrow and then the party that night,joy
And then the flight home,joy
And Brad couldn't wait to get home,joy
He just hoped that Yohji had time to talk,joy
Dear Dinah ,joy
Oh it's so soon now so quick,joy
This is the last day,joy
I didn't go to Speech this morning because there was nothing else for me to turn in,joy
I didn't find any but did find a five-dollar bathing suit,joy
Not fashionable but it fits/was five dollars,joy
Even Aaron played although he hadn't signed up,joy
Mez got a waffle-iron,joy
I got 24 shades of 80s-colored eyeshadow,joy
It was very bright,joy
We offered to do Aaron too but he just laughed and shook his head,joy
He really laughed a lot today,joy
Pacheco asked me to sign his yearbook and he signed mine,joy
I made me sorry that I don't actually know him,joy
The bell for last hour had already rung and we were talking to a bunch of Ryan's popular football-friends,joy
SorryexcusemeI'msorryIjustneed-,joy
As Mink turned from his locker and slid through the crowd Ryan watched him go,joy
Ryan nodded,joy
Yeah,joy
I know,joy
What for?,joy
Well he was in my ICP class sophomore year,joy
So we just did that,joy
To him,joy
For like a week,joy
Because all those things about Mink are exactly the reason why I can't well can't anything really,joy
And that's total bullshit because those things shouldn't even matter,joy
It's about a fucking jacket,joy
Only maybe just in different ways,joy
There are several things I know,joy
And also I look like a cat,joy
Backing out of that driveway getting further and further away from you was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do,joy
Getting home- back to reality,joy
Now I have to unpack,joy

Alright Alright,joy
You say you got a real solution,joy
Well you know,joy
You ask me for a contribution,joy

Don't you know it's gonna be alright,joy
Alright Alright,joy

You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow,joy
Don't you know know it's gonna be alright,joy
Alright Alright,joy
-- The Beatles,joy
Karl Marx was onto something,joy
Not exactly how anyone wants to go out,joy
Stiffer than a starched Eton collar,joy
Welcome to the future and recent past,joy
It will take total deprogramming,joy
It will take an exit from the current compromised system,joy
Programming In Action,joy
Like other socialists Marx and Engels sought an end to capitalism and the systems which they perceived to be responsible for the exploitation of workers,joy
- from Wikipedia,joy
I was led through an interesting internet surfing session to a full-on philosophical debate between members of these two camps in which it appears as though the Leninist scored a numbing defeat,joy
Perhaps,joy
We are a nation of air-conditioned drive-thru frequenting automatic can-opener using processed meat-eating hands-free restroom-using workers,joy
We live to work but work is not our collective life,joy
Most of us do not choose to work,joy
We work because the system demands that we operate the machinery,joy
That's the American Dream,joy
Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything,joy
I don't want you to write to your Congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write,joy
You've gotta say I'm a human being goddammit!,joy
So I want you to get up now,joy
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs,joy
and I'm not going to take this anymore!!,joy
Peter Finch as Howard Beale in Network (1976),joy
So I started my first job this week,joy
Yeah I know I'm 19 but I never worked,joy
I volunteered at a store once but that was about it,joy
I was more tired because I was used to sleeping in until like 10 but now I have to wake up at 7,joy
The job is really nice,joy
She actually knows a couple of people that I know,joy
Today sucked,joy
Again,joy
Ugh,joy
I just don't get it,joy
I'm just such a complete airhead,joy
It just feels like my brain has ceased to function,joy
Or like there like fluff in it instead of a brain,joy
'eeh,joy
okaaay then,joy
' and continues talking to someone else,joy
And then worst thing is? I don't DO anything about it,joy
(Why yes I have in fact spent the rest of the day imagining paint-based emergencies,joy
At once!),joy
Ahem,joy
I checked two poltergeist books out of the library today,joy
Yeah,joy
EWWW,joy
Well if you do remember that catchy song?,joy
You know Easy?,joy
By a band called Big Country,joy
Okay if you're going to be cooler than anyone saying that you're cooler than my mom is a fucking given,joy
He told me she has conversations with his away message online,joy
[self-explanatory],joy
Very odd and peculiar,joy
You choose the answer,joy
My first day at Banana Republic is actually going to be this Saturday not Sunday,joy
Some chick named Monica called and asked if I could work,joy
Sure,joy
No pun intended,joy
Get a fucking clue,joy
Lame lame lame comparison I know,joy
But a video like that has to be stuck in there somewhere,joy
Well,joy
I listened to a few of them,joy
The closest to the origanal is Panic!s cover on This is Halloween,joy
There are so many things that never make it past the filter into this blog,joy
I am never totally sure who is reading (people who don't have time or inclination to comment?,joy
That and time,joy
I tend to have great ideas about commentary about midday and don't get around to blogging until later and the mood has passed,joy
And you can bet I gave it a lot of thought,joy
So we are,joy
Update:,joy
Eric:,joy
first let me say this is one of the stupidest fucking reasons to be (once again) pissy with someone,joy
Fucking seriously kid,joy
This was on myspace today,joy
So I've stopped listening,joy
I attempted to have a normal conversation with him and apparently my basic human right to hang up whenever I choose to do so Is not allowed,joy
No more,joy
I dressed conservatively and had no idea what I was doing,joy
Long story short I learned a lot,joy
The results: Careless Driving (required when you hydroplane) and 2 points on my driving record and 60 dollar fine,joy
Every one was really nice even the judge,joy
I get 9 in one yr and ive never had a ticket before so I will be fine,joy
So I pulled over and ran up,joy
I walked up to him Whats going on you need some help?,joy
He said yah,joy
I backed up during all this and looked under the vehicle only to see flames roaring towards the gas tank,joy
after though I was thinking about it it would have been kinda cool to get interviewed for pulling him out,joy
I dont think I saved his life but I may have saved his legs and a lot of skin,joy
Who knows,joy
I remain anonymous in the newspaper and life goes on,joy
Poor kid though,joy
An honesty,joy
Anyways Life goes on,joy
And I've been thinking my earlier comment about how this stuff finds me Many people drove past and many cars were infront of me in that exit lane maybe this stuff is just as equally around everyone I only choose to stop,joy
but If it was more discrete and people only saw the car in the ditch or only saw me take out the sign how long would it have taken someone to stop?,joy
How many people a day drive by cars with hadards on or sitting n the side of the road,joy
He didnt even get my name but Im sure he will not forget me,joy
K enough with that kinda thought,joy
It was SOOOO nice to see them,joy
Just what I needed to collect myself and continue home,joy
Novmber 11th is the next time I will for sure be there for the weekend I have courtney and im coming down early to stay at scotts,joy
He does not know this yet I need to call him this week,joy
I can't wait to go on a night drive with Brian and just chill out there for awhile,joy
But Maria does not want me too so Paul came in for me My finger needs to get better faster,joy
Typical day I suppose,joy
Yesterday was eventful today is relaxing,joy
Im going to mail grandma a letter tonight,joy
She will be just fine,joy
I know noone who reads this besides myself so it does not matter,joy
no goal tonight,joy
Just go with the flow,joy
And not even that I can't relate or try to,joy
I just don't,joy
What also started me thinking like this is the whole dating issue,joy
There are not a lot of guys that I will go for,joy
say,joy
- I don't think it's okay to display women provocatively everywhere just to sell a product,joy
Go ahead care about the environment but don't care about demeaning women),joy
- I don't drink excessive amounts to project an image of being cool,joy
I don't drink excessive amounts because I am bored,joy
- I listen,joy
- I actually take notice of nice days smells etc and appreciate it appreciate the luxuriousness of things like that and let it effect me I don't just trample it in my Uggs,joy
- I try not to listen to rap because it perpetuates stereotypes,joy
- I don't say like every other word,joy
Nor do I continually inflect the ends of my sentences upwards,joy
I could go on,joy
Meh,joy
Its not my bag and I don't really even want to be around it,joy
What is so wrong about REMEMBERING the weekend?,joy
Please if you exist anywhere let me know!,joy
All of my co-workers are people like that,joy
So I did and then the second dog growls at me too and Im likeShould I run or keep walking?,joy
So I kept walking and then the other dog that crossed the street comes back running at me and I said OHH SSHHIITTT!!!,joy
And I saw a house with the gate door opened slightly and I squeezed in there sumhow sumway!!!,joy
WITH MY BACKPACK ON ME!!!,joy
So yeah I stayed in that house for like three minutes then I got up and checked to see if the dogs were gone and they were so I tried squeezing out the same way I squeezed in but I didnt fit so I just opened the door and left,joy
I WUZ SCARED!!!,joy
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow ,joy
-The Rose,joy
Bette Middler,joy
There is a prospect and I think I am going to go for him,joy
I think I will wake from the dream and I will see if I cannot turn it into a reality,joy
I did an SAT Lit practice test on each bus ride because I am cool and I did better than I expected,joy
If you haven't heard them search iTunes and download the Podcast,joy
The staff is currently in the process of archiving every one of these 30-45 second clips ever made so I spent almost all day going through them,joy
I had to listen to each fully and make note of any audio or labelling defects and whether there was an advertisement at the end,joy
I totally loved it because I am a geek,joy
At first I thought that someone had inexplicably decided to RV in the middle of Broadway but a man with a French accent told me it was for a Will Smith movie,joy
I went out to Starbucks for lunch,joy
**As in Farrell I assume,joy
Funny she usually thinks I'm Nora,joy
Hey all ,joy
I got a call this morning asking me to come in for an interview today at 1:30pm,joy
I was psyched,joy
ugh,joy
I went back had 6 mins to go get it and get back to the bus stop,joy
I got it got back to the station and my bus came right away,joy
I got on the bus dropped my resume on the wet floor and almost dropped my mp3 player,joy
So I tried to relax on the bus on the way,joy
When I got there I went in and told them I was there and waited,joy
They told me that they would set me up for the next interview by calling me in the next day or 2,joy
The next interview is with the general manager of the store it will likely take place on Saturday,joy
The 2 interviewing me were thinking of placing me in digital imaging due to my background with photography and video editing I told them that it would likely turn out to be too easy for me in the long run and that I was hoping for a position more challenging so that I could learn more overall,joy
I said that I want to work in the TV department as I want to learn more about them,joy
Oh if I get a job at Futureshop It looks like I would be starting there around November 8th,joy
We'll see how things go,joy
My plans coming up,joy
Tomorrow: Gotta go to MDG for the last time to pick up my paycheck for that week and a half I was there,joy
Friday: Going to a movie or 2 with Paul at Rainbow cinemas,joy
Saturday: Hopefully the interview at futureshop,joy
Oct 21st: If I'm free I want to check out Brad Sucks live in concert,joy
I would try to do some video too,joy
That is all for now ,joy
So yeah I did,joy
The night before I was really,joy
Seriously,joy
Okay,joy
So that night I decide,joy
Hmm I remember Gareth's password why don't I spy to see whats going on,joy
I never would do that but I had to because I was speculating about the whole thing,joy
So I did and I got so panicy that I only got to the 6th page,joy
and I was freak it,joy
So,joy
Really scared,joy
So he kinda knew something was wrong,joy
So I did anyway,joy
in a WORD document,joy
and he said that it was understandable,joy
And he said I gave you my password for a reason so we wouldn't have to keep secrets from each other,joy
Majorly,joy
Then,joy
And I was like,joy
Well if you want,joy
But I was like Do what you want,joy
He's like yeah he would wait a couple of weeks and delete her,joy
but it happened,joy
because then afterwards I had a BIG HEADACHE!,joy
But I feel okay,joy
Ehh,joy
it's a little more complicated,joy
have u ever been chased with a knife?,joy
so I ain't much to prove,joy
