It's been a solid half year since I sent word out and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email
So to the task!
Well
I believe it was April and spring had just arrived
He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel hadn't even checked in yet and just happened to be in the lobby when I was
So he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour
We had a great time catching up and went out that night together as well
The rest of April passed rather uneventfully and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater
It's moments like that that remind me why I've chosen theatre as a profession
I saw most of the major sites on my own and I went to the theater almost every night I was there
Horribly acted horribly directed weak script
And interminably long!
It was nice to understand that just wish I didn't have to experience it first hand
While in London I also saw Coriolanus at the Globe Theater
Now this was amazing
Shakespeare old school
The performers were incredible and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire
Loved London
Loved the free museums
Especially the British Museum
Great East London accents
Soooo many monuments including two statues in front of Buckingham Palace that had a conspicuous Communist message
It was a worker with a hammer and a peasant woman with a sickle situated behind Queen Victoria's back and glowering at the palace
Now maybe I was just reading too much into this or maybe I had spent too much time in the eastern bloc talking about Communist symbolism
But I don't' think so
And the funniest part the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand
Curious
After London came the World Cup
That changed very quickly
Then there were the Brazilians everywhere singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs
Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began if you waved a German flag in the streets you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter
So
In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians celebrities writers (such as Guenther Grass and Christa Wolf) and other intellectuals about the meaning origin and impact of this nationalism
And of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the Germans
In June I had also been training at work to lead tours of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp which I started at the end of the month
I ended up doing tours out there for the duration of the summer
I was planning on going to Greece sometime anyway so we spent three days in Athens and two and a half in Cyprus
Now take into account that said air conditioners are mounted on the windows sticking out over the street
Now add a couple of poorly placed ancient columns
But it was close
But two days back to back was more than enough
Now this was really amazing
The sky is so amazing in Greece it feels like you could really reach up and touch it it's so close!
Just FYI
They also bake bread for you on the plane so that your in flight meal is fresh
Cyprus was amazing
We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights
And they weren't kidding
What's more we had the whole place to ourselves
It was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about
They make their own very strong coffee and Haloumi cheese which we were told (a hundred different times by all the little old ladies) was goat cheese
But not feta
Haloumi
Haloumi has nothing to do with Feta
Its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones
After returning from Greece my last few weeks in Berlin passed very quickly
I was leading loads of tours and working on a short film I was directing
Lance and I spent the better part of the next three days lounging around Zurich and drinking in Switzerland
People say London or Paris is expensive; no
Zurich is expensive
We had a ball in Zurich
After our detox detour en Suisse we headed via night train to Paris
So many public spaces parks museums gardens
And people are out in them all the time
There was a fabulous sense of community there
So we went across the street to the park it was about 2:00 pm
There were people all over the place and lots of benches and chairs
We noticed that about half of the chairs were slanted at a 45 degree angle
I thought: that's strange what's that about?
Well when in Rome
so we did the same
Had a little hour sleep got back up and headed back into the colossal Louvre for another few hours
Vive la France!
We really had a ball in Paris

Some of my teachers seem quite amazing and others I know for a fact to be amazing
Ah well
It's nothing a strong woman such as myself cannot handle with a little bit of DragonForce and mental pep talks
I can come through this year triumphantly and with grace
I have looked forward to this year even before last year ended
This is the year where everything happens
This is the year when I get to test myself: my mind my body and myself
This is my first year where I am truly Nyssa Jane Towsley
Ah well

I forgot how demeaning BME classes are
Dr Roy my prof for BME 314 expects us to have taken an Anatomy/Physiology class at some point in our lives
I haven't
He was asking all these questions that I was completely baffled by and people were just spouting answers
Sometimes I wonder how in the world I made it in and every day I wonder how I'm going to make it through
I mean we already need 133 (ish) hours to graduate which for you non college people is about 8-10 more than any engineering major and more than that more for a non engineering major
I dont' know where that is yet
I'm going to finish my book before I go to bed
I think I spent the better part of two hours reading today
I learned that the Life Sciences library in the main building has exceedingly comfortable couches Anyhoo

Does an afterlife really exist?
That's one hour a week
There would be a constant trepedation that there is no gold at the end of that rainbow
Different songs keep on playing
Its all official we sorted it out at the civic centre on Friday
Its a funny old game life but I think I am one step closer to understanding its purpose and meaning now
I wept for all the mistakes I made where I put my feelings before the feelings of others
I wept for all the times I said f*ck you instead of thank you
can you buy it?
can it be sold?
can you get there and back on a half tank of gas?
I think you can
We are all essentially the same person
other then physical attributes - what really makes us so different from one another
Theoretically
is there anything that Einstein did that I couldn't do
we both have the same tools (a brain) so why can't I come up with a grad theory of relativity
Simply because that is not where I have been directing my energy to
The brain is an amazing tool and can be sculpted for any purpose
however most people don't exert the mental energy required to expand your train of thought
Have you ever met anyone without a fully developed brain?
They look at things only on the surface and read into nothing
Listlessly they scratch at there head and the chains of thought don't delve to deep
I think it is very easy to understand people once you realize that all people carry all the same personalities - just expressed to different proportions and degrees
Whatever thought can be imagined - someone has taken that to the extreme
the combination of all people balanced into one
as defined by the dictionary
Balanced
(of a person or state of mind) having no emotion lacking or too strong; stable : a balanced personality
but when you try to become your own mental chemist - ingesting chemicals to alter your feelings - you screw up the balance
The testes stop producing testosterone because it senses there is already too much testosterone in the system
For example - the more you use chapstick - the less your lips produce their own moisture - making you further dependent on chapstick
So this morning I get a phone call from my sister
Third she starts asking why I have only posted pics so my dear sister this is for you
She wouldn;t come down today so instead of being bored out of my mind I went antiquing
I figure I have a couple extra bucks so I budget a certain amount
Ok I spent 4 times what I budgeted but I wanted that desk
I almost bought this cool shiney glass tumbler up thingy
I was dragged away (it will be there tomorrow and I can go back alone)
Ok the alignment was out on her BMW when she bought it and it wiped out the tires
I tend to think not
She said that a mechanic told her that the frame was bent
I called the mechanic and inquired about it
On that car it won't affect alignment
I have twice the work experience required for the job and I have alot more schooling than is required
I got her less than $50000 back
So when she writes her letter to the Commissioner and the director of vehicle safety reads my report he will understand why I appear not to take her side
I made lunch for a luncheon at work yesterday
They saw what I meant when they started eating it
They went back for more
They all complimented on it
He's a great guy and I think the world of him
Ok I've said enough
I need to figure what I'm going to throw out so I can move that desk from the middle of the dining room to one of the 2 rooms upstairs I occupy
For instance if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time my need for connection has not been met
Probably too many to count
So what can we do?
We can become conscious of what is going on inside us
Marshall Rosenberg author of Nonviolent Communication has a four-step process for communication that incorporates identifying our feelings and needs into the model
Rosenberg also calls this four step process giraffe language
He coined it giraffe language because the giraffe has the largest heart of all the mammals
The heart is about 3 feet long and 3 inches thick all around
If we are not correct they will correct us and we will be closer to identifying the need they have and finding a way to resolve the situation
By satisfying our needs and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation
We can make a list of these feelings and be on the look out for them
Then when we are calm focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others
For more information on Nonviolent Communication click here
Highlights:
- Help out with a conference at Bouremouth with the Conservative party had the 'privelage' of taking of THe Mr Cameron and his whole entourage
- going on training next week can't wait to get pissed with all the graduates
Sorry for the rather crappy update will try to do a proper one later

Dec 20 till 30th!
I

AGAIN
Other than that I also got a extension from my affiliate to get the fanlisiting I adopted up since the server move and etc Meh I miss Cassy
T_T eheh
Though I was allowed to stay up until 1 AM last night
But heh thats basically it
Theres nothing left to say so this is the end of my journal entry
Well short one anyway
This is my update for today and I am off
It's the veils
Yes the veils that many Muslim women around the world traditionally wear
I'm not going to get into the wrongs and rights just to give a bit of perspective
Listen
Let's clarify
Hijab is a headscarf that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck
The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes or in some cases nothing at all
Taleban style if you will
This is called the nikab
For clarification the difference should be noted
Hijab in Islam actually means modesty or privacy
And it is believed that women should practice modesty both for themselves but to keep the gazing eyes of man down
The khimar is the actual headscarf
The veil that covers the entire face is called the nikab
Islam requires women to be modest henceforth many of them wear the hijab or headscarf
The nikab or taliban style cover is not an Islamic practice
A Fatwa or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam (just like the west has some Christian right wackies)
It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities
Jack Straw is calling for a ban of veils or nikabs in the UK
Not the ban on hijabs
But if the UK Muslims are listening to Mr Livingstone he's on to something
He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community
Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this
I'm by no means an expert on veils
What I do know is that there are many many woman who absolutely voluntarily and willingly cover themselves with a headscarf for religious purposes
So the voluntary and involuntary
The Brits haven't ventured that far they accept the head scarf but oppose the ninja turtle look
Turkey has a similar issue
In its bid to become a secular society -- and to integrate into the unwelcoming arms of the European Union it has forbidden even the nikab and in some places even the hijab in public schools and universities
Sarajevo now has a large female Turkish population coming to study here so they can wear what they wish
Bosnian Islam is very secular and indeed seen by most European leaders as a model example of the type of Islam they want being taught in their increasing number of mosques and madressa's within the EU
The question of hijab and nikabs hasn't come up yet here in Bosnia
The hijab is accepted and tolerated as are the nikab wearers (which is an extremely small percentage of Muslim women)
The progressive west is certainly faltering when it comes to questions of its growing Muslim populations and addressing the cultural and religious difference between east and west
This door has to swing both ways
The west must do more to grasp the concepts of Islam - and understand the vast cultural differences even with the large and diverse Muslim community which covers three continents
If western women can run around half naked can eastern women completely cover themselves?
Is there really a difference?
We all need to take the veils off
and look at each other eye to eye
Brother to brother face to face let's unite the human race
I'm EXTREMELY sad to say that it looks as though The Skyline Obscura will be on an indefinate hiatus as of this past Thursday
With that some of the new songs that never were will be posted shortly for those of you who want to hear it
Sorry for the letdown and I can't speak for everyone else but I'd rather have this happen now than later
Feel free to contact any of us individually about this if you feel so compelled as nobody's really going to be monitoring this site any more
(our individual pages are under the members section)
Thanks for the support!
You'll all receive notices of any Skyline updates and/or updates of new projects involving anyone from TSO (past or pseudo-present)
Take care of each other
Well my MIL arrived yesterday
My SIL and niece came over yesterday afternoon to collect our great-nephew Brandon
He wanted B to stay at least for today so that he had a day off to play with him
Brandon's dad Michael is improving
Hey how has everyone been lately?
It's been a while
and there has been so much going on
and it's been just a big jumble of AWOIWEJFPWKSFWEIONMQMEM!
lol just kidding
Especially people
lol)
Anyway this past week has been one of the busiest ones yet for me and maybe for you too
Sometimes all we need is that little encouragement or motivation to get us going again
like the energizer bunny!!!
:D lol wow
Okay that's about it for now
What I completed in one day today was not possible to me last week
Today I can say I actually taught for all three of my periods
I walked into my first period only to find a sub
I asked the sub if he did not mind my taking over and of course he complied
I figured I knew the material more than he did and more importantly I knew the students and how the class should run
So the bell rang the sub introduced himself and I took over
I had them write in their journals for a few minutes then proceeded to facilitate the day's assignments
I allowed them 10-15 minutes to finish up the work from yesterday before we began a new piece of literature
After they turned that in I introduced Poor Richard's Almanacwhich we read as a class
This was a very short reading so I gave the class an assignment to go along with the reading
They had the remainder of the class to complete the assignment while I went around to monitor their work and answer questions
The period ran smoothly under my direction most suprisingly to me I actually liked being thrown into the situation without having prior knowledge
For today's lesson I taught them how to determine the mood in a piece of literature based on the definition an example and a story out of their literature books
I began my lesson by explaining what the term mood meant
I explained to them that the mood of the story could be determined based on the word choice used by the author
To give them a better understanding of how mood works I presented them with a paragraph that I wrote on the overhead
I had them follow along as I read out loud
After I was done reading my paragraph I had the students tell me what was the mood I had created
Almost everyone participated and for every type of mood they came up with I had them point out places in the paragraph that helped them to determine the mood
That was a segway into today's story
Today we read The Talk by Gary Soto
I gave a brief background on the author and the story before we began
I read the first paragraph then I drew names out of my little tin container to complete the reading
After certain spots I would have them go over plot summary just to make sure they were following along
At the end of the story I had them do the same thing they did with my paragraph to determine the mood
After a discussion I asked them to take out a piece of paper
They answered on their papers then shared out as a class
This completed my very first lesson for periods 3 amp; 6
Wow I hardly ever have plans
I went to the OVAC volleyball tournament this morning and was gone almost all day and I'm going skating with one of my friends tonight
Got to go out for breakfast with the team even though I'm not a member
I'm the libero tracker
The libero is a defensive specialist and I have to keep track of who she goes in and out for
Today rocks!
She's not a skating-type person though
We always try to get her to come but it doesn't work
We'll just have to drag her down to the rink one of these days lol!
xx I need to invest in a pair of blades
I outgrew my skates and I don't like renting
Plus I've heard blades are easier than four-wheels and I can use all the help I can get
o___x
Stephenie Meyer
What can I say?
She's amazing
This list is very short
In fact there's only about three authors whose books I will buy no matter the storyline
Meyer JK Rowling and Meg Cabot
And yes I read hundreds thousands of books from other people
But these female writes
I'm a writer
I know that
I'm enough of a grown-up to say it
And after reading Stephenie's story about how real her characters are
how they can take over her outlines
The story leads me not the people who grace the page
And Stephenie says that we should know our characters
Sigh
Well I know that a lot of my LJ friends are writers too
I can tell
hm
Well any advice on writing would be appreciated

You know that the Mass Pike is some sort of strange weather dividing line
You know that P-Town isn't the name of a new rap group
You do not recognize the letter R as a part of the English language
You keep an ice scraper and can of de-icer on the floor of your car
So ok this happened like week before last but I thought it was funny enough to mention today
So Brandon and I were chilling out one night at home after being out all night and we decided to step out on the patio for a quick smoke
The cops come outta nowhere this time
They all fly off in EVERY direction to find this kid (of course except the direction I said he went)
The cops spend more time driving down my road then they probably should
There are moments in our lives when we find ourselves at a crossroad
The choices we make in these moments can define the rest of our days
But once in a while people push on
Into something better
And it's only when you're tested that you discover who you can be
My worst fears have been personified
I have no details
No dates
No times
No nothing
I only know that it could be anytime within the next 60 days
Hey guys!
=P
^_^;
HEY
If you don't know what to get me for christmas get me some socks!!
~Apple ipod socks
As for my diet
Eh
its not that much but hey its something!
^_^
the season is changing
again
a lot of things have happened to me in the past six months since the beginning of summer
though I do not mind this one tiny bit it has been odd for me I'm rarely the strong one
something it seems I am getting more and more used to
didn't see that one coming
now I have no idea what I believe and what I want to do and how I want to spend the rest of my life
well maybe I do
but that scares me even more
and well I got married
I find myself again stuck in a place where I have to rediscover myself all over again
maybe I do
but I don't want to admit that yet
though I think I have
so stay tuned
changes to come
perhaps too much so for 5:15 on a saturday afternoon but hey what can you do
gotta milk those quarter-life crises for all they're worth
don't get another one for 25 more years
I must go now
have a great idea for a new scarf
want to get it done in time for the next snowfall
Well I seem to have done that
I was just scared
I mean
I'm scared of my future
I look around me and you know what I see?
I just can't help it
But then I also think what if they are the right person?
Some people say Katrina do thisothers say Katrina do that
What do I say?
I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!!!!
Welp today has been a long tiring day lol
lol
He's sleeping now but everytime I lay down and think I will get atleast a couple hours of sleep hes right back up!
lol
He sleeps most of the day and then never sleeps at night
I am not to thrilled about going over there
lol and so we figgured we would just go to Six Flags
HAHA!
thats what you get for rubbing it in my face that your 21 and im not!)
LOL
Almost sounds like an EMO song title
Maybe it is I dunno
All I know is that I have no time to do anything anymore
At least the price of gas is going down $199 per gallon across the street now
I'm also working at the YMCA every Monday in October which helps but makes me tired as all get out
The job is still just that
I have a new pic of Melissa and I which I will post shortly
We need a new pic
Bagpiping got moved to one of our together nights so that puts a small damper on the time we see each other for every week
Oh well at least we can make it work without lots of time
It's kinda far from where I am but it is worth it
The indoor range has 8 lanes but is only 15 yards long
We are starting to get some interesting inquiries
Also since I belong to a variety of social organizations it was easy to make concert contacts through them
Who knows where we will be playing in 2007
I have my eyes on a few locations like Kwajalein RMI and Soto Cano-Honduras; with friends in low places we'll probably get those gigs
The list of folks who want a copy of the CD-First Light is being built up one name at a time
Anyone who wants one I will send one
Ha!
Wouldn't that be a gig!?
In the mean time I am going after every venue available
Leaving for Irvine on the 18th for Maiden
See you mates up front of Arrys monitor!
I'm at Penn State for the weekend
Tonight is the Michigan vs PSU game
Tonight is also the drag show which I shall be attending faithfully
Wow
I'm reading this back to myself and I'm totally yawning
Let's face it
I don't drink anymore
Hard alcohol would surely have put me in the ER
And this hair
Lex Squared told me that she could do something with my hair
That's a polite way of saying
I'm staying with Kristen Ward
She has 4 boys staying her who attend West Point
Hi
They're cute
So I toned down the performance and slept until right now
I almost died
Look at me! I'm like Ellen on straight television
I'm a maneater!
Oh and Ps!
Totally mine
I feel like I should be writting right now
The other week I was at Roxy with Robbie and company and the crack house came up
How much you give me for this Bacon?
nevermind I've got an Arabic test I could be studying for
ones worth retelling?
Within a week I bid on and won about 14 cookie jars
They are just so cute I can't resist them although I think I am under control now
At least I haven't bought any in about four days
I still have six that have not arrived yet
Oh well I will find space or have Tim build me some shelves
One cookie jar was not packed well
HE KNEW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT PACKING he said
Well needless to say his packing job was far below any I have seen so far
Man I just can't seem to keep out of trouble
I even sold a few things on Ebay
Will have to work on that enterprise
Tim and I have been fishing and camping
There always seems to be much to do around here and we don't seem to get much done
Or at least I don't
Tim is working on putting a border fence up in the front of the property
Then he wants to put in an underground sprinkler system before we plant grass in front
We also will be planting trees and shrubs in front and some day putting a small deck coming out of the front door
We have come a long way in a year though!
Well must go put dinner in the oven
Homemade macaroni and cheese
With all this cheese we will probably be constipated tomorrow
Mmk
Thursday:
Then later hung out with some loser until like 12
Friday:
Chels and I cleaned my room which was much needed
Then Ashlie and Becky came and picked me up we stopped at Joey's to see if they had any applications then went out to the mall so I could turn in some apps and so Ashlie could buy some underwears
I came home and got my stuff together to go up to the kid's camp
Even after getting off the phone with her I balled forever
It was sooo cold out seeing as I don't have a winter jacket or anything
It was real lame
Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting
Today Chels made me a sandwhich since she loves me and I had some soup so I feel better
I'm going out for a little tonight and then I'm gonna see if Ash and Beck want to stay
Then Tomorrow
It all started a month ago in kickboxing class (at least that part sounds way cool)
The new instructor is a former marine and showed us these five-pointed-star push-ups
Anyway I get home and notice my knee feels kinda tight
But after a month that hasn't really happened
So I'm old but I have these really cute Etienne Aigner boots to show for it
Well you know what?
In the last fifteen years 
my life has been somewhat conventional:
job wife two kids house car
Seen from a distance I've been following the script 
the path that society lays down for people like me
have been when we have turned the script upside-down;
skipped a line or a page or an act;
swapped parts;
cut pages up and rearranged them;
This is me my self-fashioned self
I will not play the part that others have chosen for me
This happened again today
Sucks for Levon but he said he wouldn't let me drive with the trailer anyways
But I'm free til' Aug 31st
Everybody call me Just letting you all know I suck at at tests
first: heh heh heh so appropriate fer me
I dunno press the button and find out
second
couldn't the fucking terrorists decide to get caught you know after I landed?
no of course not
or convert everyone to Islam or just blow you up one by one in a fucking plane train or automobile
let me calculate how long that'll take with current rates of reproduction and the current world population
never
so fuck off
you've killed less people in the last six years than we did to ourselves in a week in 1916
so fuck off
we do it much better anyway
that's all that matters isn't it?
the state of our souls
more virgins for you
the quota might drop to 45 or something
I'm being a little flippant here but I'm sure you get the point
maybe I should draw a cartoon
oh right I forgot that's a no go area either
you know why?
because when you piss us off we have to used measured restraint
we have to be diplomatic
now
I am a rational intelligent rather well informed individual
AND I'M ANNOYED
because I know
in nine days I will spend probably 5-6 hours in aiports whereas 10 years ago
not so much
why must I show up three hours early for my flight?
but basically my mind will stray to one mantra
fuck off
The job was frustrating today
Well actually I have to be BUT
So some guy will call
'I'm not recieving the paper
but I sent in a check 3 weeks ago
' OK so
I look up the address he mumbles to me and see that no payment has come in for 5 months
What am I supposed to say other than 'we did not recieve your ''supposed'' recent payment'
Then they throw a little hissy fit for 5 minutes as I repeat myself over and over
And then they hang up
Or some woman will call with a question that has nothing to do with circulation
So
I ask Robbye knowledge of all things Ann Arbor News
But really Ive only had the job a few weeks
And originally I was supposed to be given some book of all knowledge
That never happened
And then the dispatcher was all pissy with me over some redelivery shenanigans I was doing wrong
So no cubicle job for life for me
I saw Phil
I went to Sheldon's house
We sat outside on his porch
Sheldon Phil Daniel and I
Sheldon and I told him to shut up
I tried to control myself
He was so good-looking
His hair his eyes his dimples
He has a new eye brow piercing
It suits him
It's still too soon to make those comments
But he did
Because he knew I needed the reaction
haha
Phil reluctantly came along
He didn't want to make eye contact with me but we made eye contact a lot
And I didn't try to touch him
I didn't want to make physicaly contact
Was I wrong to be taken aback by that?!
No
Then when we were there I got what I needed as did they and I was standing outside with Phil as the other two were still in there
And that it's him now
He whatevered me UGH
I assured him you do care
You just don't show it anymore
and by then they guys were out of the store
Phil walked away quickly
Are you okay? He asked
Yeah I'm going to go home
You're not coming with us?
No I'm going to go
Why?
Is it really that hard to tell?
I know I shouldn't have been snotty about it but I thought it was fucking obvious
I hung up and started walking home
Like 10 minutes into walking home aaron pulled up to drive me home
I never even told him what happened but he helped a lot
ive missed it so
I had a lot of time to myself in the car which I used
I thought a lot about different things and I wrote more than I have in a long long time
but for now im going to go experience how fabulous the night sky smells
I've been having random fears and doubts lately but that happens
I suppose there's been a fair amount of drama including some with my ex Sadie
It'll turn out one way or another
Bah
As always
I have work in the morning then three days off
Woot
Yeah
Oh well
Later
And I did it in about 10 minutes
I'm the man!
PS If you don't understand exactly what I did (it's a bit technical) just know that it was impressive and I rock
So it's Friday night and here I am in front of the computer screen
So I spent the day watching The Real World: Austin with my little brother
But anyway so we watched tv during the morning and when 4pm came by we decided to do laundry and play Burnout 3; I beat his ass!
LOL
Then my parents came home and I deicided I'd make donoughts
But other than that I feel really alone right now because it's Friday and I'm home!
Do your job and do it well- and it will speak volumes for you
Congratulations- and Welcome to Corporate America- where the Vice Presidents and Senior Officers and Managers don't hibernate-- they walk among you
I'm focused
I have a 99 average in my class
yeah- I'm not going anywhere
That means if I stay on the right path- when I'm 25 I could be an ABT Trainer 2 as well- or the equivalent
I could be an IT Specialist V in 4 years
I could be Paul Amos Jr's secretary- if I work hard enough
The advancement opportunities are just awesome
The sole stipulation: Do your time first
Spend 1 year answering calls for the Claims spread- and then be free to go to where-ever your heart desires
Don't like it?
Just move somewhere else!
Speaking of the famous Amos' -( not the cookie people EICON1 - the AFLAC founders)- I passed Dan Amos in the hallway yesterday
I want that
I've realized what I want in life
I want a family
I've been staying at Mary's house and she keeps telling me I'd be an awesome mommy
She told me 4 times yesterday
Yeah- I really would
(The AFLAC All-American Baseball Classic)
I monitored calls today with Julia
I have the world in the palm of my hands
The corporate world at least
I'm still working on that family part
but I've not talked to the most important person in my life- in over a week
I don't know what to do
Or he would've come through last weekend
The thread to this relationship is wearing thin- it's on it's last strand- and though he may think it's cool to not do what he says hes going to- it's not cool to me
It's not over
We're still together- and we still have the opportunity to make things right - - - but I'm a very patient person- and it's been close to 5 years now- and my patience is wearing thin
Something has to happen SOON
I would like to be married before I'm 23
Wayne just called me!!!!!!!!
Apparently it was not Wayne alone who was misled
The rest of the troop that he was sent with thought they were only going for 12 months
So they thought they were going for 12 and Wayne thought he was going for 10 and then one day BOOM they are staying for 16
So they are getting to come home for a short time after thier training
Now they don't know yet when that will be but I don't care
I will get that 5 days and then later on he will still get RnR
That was the first thing that I thought will that cut down yalls RnR? and he said no
It is just something they get to do because they are having to go longer than intended or however they word that!
Alley still hasn't had those pups
I told her that she better get on the ball and she looked at me and yawned so maybe that was a yes lol
It has been 4 days since her milk dropped and they are supposed to have the pups after 5
We'll see
Keep in mind that we had only just moved in together at that time and he didn't know much about whelping pups!
He had watched me dock two litters but still he did a great job
Now he wishes that he was here to help with this litter Image
As far as school goes
I start my very last class Monday
I feel very uninspiring
Argh!
I need it and I want it
I didn't even know he watched that
Not kidding!
He the Brady Bunch
If I went and got in the car right now
and chase me out
OH OH OH he is yelling at me Are you ready to go already!
Like it's me holding up the show!
Talk to you later!
Three people have been laid off at the office in the past hour

Attention seeker ? Most likely
Mmk on to the next subject Thursday amp; Friday:

Dancing ASB dancing ASB back amp; forth
Hahah
My two fingers that I tie the ballons with were smelled like balloons
Ew
Hahah

Sucks I didn't bring my camera but yeeah
That was my week
amp; I think tomorrow a friend`s coming over ? Not sure who haha kaay bye
Posted 8/11/2006 at 8:53 PM - email it
I must say this summer has gone by in the blink of an eye
what seemed like 4 months off has seemed like it at all
not that I had 4 months off in the end
So far I have done zip camping no trips to the lake
I am getting so tired of this studying for my securities exam
I go for my practicum interview next week along with a 2 day orientation at PI
Should be interesting
I haven't really given school much thought as of recent times
I have been so focused on this course and going to work with my dad that I really don't know what to think anymore
I started with one dream and was working towards it now I don't see it anymore
I am curious as to see where this all goes with my dad and who knows I may just take over his book of business and all that
whoot
it gets me out of the job I'm in and will open the doors to other opportunities that aren't available to me now
Maybe I have become lazy in thought b/c I don't bother with it
and stress
society has become just one big stress pool
Our conversations with family friends co-workers etc all seem to revolve around how crappy are day is has been or is going to be and it seems all like we compete with one another to see who has a crappier one
where I am going with this I have no clue
I don't have a plan I don't know what I want in the long run
I'm just taking it as it comes
one day one week at a time
I can only take so much of her though for her sake and mine EICON1
I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life
one I am not thinking long term
maybe more so
I needed to start over new
They are better off where they are now
we are all moving forward on our own path
hopefully the right one
I have a list of things I want to do during my time and each day I add something new to it
it says a lot even if it was written by a comedian
A few days ago I ran into this article online: http://msnbcmsncom/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low
I definitely feel like moreso than any other time in my life I'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends
You build friendships as fortifications against getting too old too fast but sometimes life just catches up with you regardless of your efforts
On a big picture scale I'd like to believe that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old now a scary half-a-lifetime ago
If I didn't have the desire to be better than what I currently am would I have impetus to keep living at all?
if the goals are similar which one would you prefer to be?
Now which one are you most of the time?
Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia and before long you wonder if it ever happened
So what does this mean to me then?
I'm not going to go into specifics here but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears
My only plausible explanation is that I want out
I know its normal for someone who's in college to be living with their parents but that doesn't quell the wish to be independent and free
Frenchie Fucked Off
Now me and Tyler are running the shop and I don't know if Tyler's even going to stay or not
It's been a week and I'm still really pissed off
But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself and he said he just doesn't have enough time
The look on my face I think said it all
This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am leaves by 3pm takes 20minutes to get to the office dry cleans all his clothes has a cleaner doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 15 hours each way every day to go to work I go to the gym more than he does I cook my meals I have a life and I have a house to look after
I choose to do more important things with my time
great life choices right there
no wonder he doesn't have a girlfrend if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult isn't important enough
Urgh
AARRGGHH!!!
She slams on her brakes stops her car right in front of me in the middle of the street and gets out
Then she comes up to me and starts yelling at me
I said
 She threatened
I tried to bike away- what was she gonna do?
Write down my licensce plate?
She grabbed the handlebars of my bike and tried to push me off
Now people are already honking and stuff because her daddy's lexus is blocking the intersection
We're struggling with my bike
hey she assulted me in the middle of an intersection
and I was on a fucking BIKE
fucking A
I woke up on Wednesday morning bright and early (as I do) to go into work/uni
But then one of my housemates who was already up informed me that no it was that the electricity wasn't working anywhere in the house
Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house switching the safety switch back on and then sequentially turning everything back on until the safety was tripped
We tried everything to make sure it wasn't the plug/circuit itself
But no it was the fridge
We thought for a while about what to do not really being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one
offered to give us her fridge (woooo!)
but will joyfully be picking the other one up today
Wooo!
YAY!
Well maybe
I feel like I could fly
ive come to realise also how different I am with him
not different me or anything different in how I am in OUR relationship compared to my others
and im sure he's been doing the same
we're friends and lovers and everything inbetween that
I want to be everything he needs and more
and ive learned from my past relationship what to do and what not to do and watching what I say and how I say it and
ALL these things im more aware of the relationship and it status and im not 
I better not considering the circumstances
so no I wont have my head too high up my ass about it but im noot going to sit here and think/dread it everyday either
somehow
its completely unlike anything I had with chris rerally but jamie has a lot of personality like chris did
he could car eless about anything and everything as long as he got his way everything was alright
stupid ass hole!
can someone tell me please?!
oh yeh I was sub-conciously restraining myself and waiting for Jamie EICON1
Let's try and finish Sunday now for the third time before it is Sunday again!
Haven't seen him in ages
Goes figure he'd be there
Anyhow not important though
Oh ya we were talking about Land Rovers!
W0rd!
That was funny
Everyone at the table was giggeling
W0rd I am dead tired!
Gonna push through with this!
Her niece and Lizelle came along
That be the only reason cos everyone is scared of driving with me >> Don't ask
:P I drive well now though yep I do!
but don't think they would let you do that
NooooOOoo
I took lots of photo's!
Will try and upload them somewhere or do something or I will see!
Okies!
I took photo's of this little girl swimming in the ocean
The water is freezing cold by the way and it is winter and we sat there dressed warmly!
Somehow Anri got the idea in her head that I had to go test the water so that she can take photo's and like that was not enough I had to throw Baywatch moves
You know that Baywatch running style from that tv program
Funny photo's came out there
I wanted to take photo's of Kiteboarders but there were none!
oO Took a photo of him he was a bit far though
I would like to just walk around or sit somewhere where lotsa people are and take photo's of them especially like action photo's!
I totally zone out
We went to Anri's house for cake and coffee
Hmmm
cake ^^ ICE-CREAM!
We sat there 'trying to decide' what we are going to do
We almost sat there for an hour
That was as clear as daylight
So we basicly had to wait for Anri to decide
Hm
what do you pick
so we went and it was nice to be there!
:p
They went to the movies afterwards
Anri promised to come to my house after the movie to keep me awake while I work
Didn't think she would do it but hey!
Ye
I am too tired now
will finish later
I want to pose a serious question to anyone out there that chooses to read this
No I'm not a stupid chick for those of you that may be wondering
Would you be careful and try to preserve every moment you have left?
So I tried to step out of myself for a minute and look at things the way he may have been viewing them
An athelete
You are virtually unstoppable
All you have to do is decide which opportunity you would like to take advantage of first
The world is still yours for the taking
So you make an appointment with a recruiter for an interview and physical
Everything goes well with the interview
You go home wait two weeks then return to the recruiter's office for the results of your background check and physical
The look on the recruiter's face is unmistakable
He begins to speak while you're planning I'm sorry to have to tell you this(ok I can move back home for a while and go back to school and work on my degree
So what do you do?
This is the story as it was given to me and when I heard it I was pissed
First because I could already piece together the backdrop of the story
See I knew he had cheated
lol)
I'm like For what?
I couldn't answer her
Really what did make me think that?
I would have given this man who obviously had little regard for me my life in exchange for his bullshit and lies
I realized that my life belongs to me Fuck the bullshit
He never took any medications other than a multi-vitamin
I wonder what changed his mind about that?
I've asked him about this and he has never really given me an answer
I wonder how many other people have made the same decision that he made
So what would you do?
The question itself is mostly rhetorical presented to raise awareness and provoke thought moreso than response
All will be greatly appreciated
im going to be trashed
even tho I have work on monday which is my bday cause shop rite sucks my dick
im usually always so pumped for my bday
but right now its just reminding me that everyones leaving me
I seriously dont know what I am going to do at all
and everyone thats home is so wrapped up with their own stuff ///dudes//women
it just sucks when everything youve known for years just disappears
alfkjaslkjfasjflka;sjdf;asjfals;fjlakjsf
im done talking about it
I cried on the way home from myrtle
for many reasons
nothing hereee
im hearbroken lt;/3
myrtlelt;/3
I just do not want to live at home anymore
im just annoyed
but nobody else is for moving out as much as I am
all my substitute information is in
if I can get a job at taylors
and I can get a new car
then convince someone to move out with me
since everyone I wanted to get an apt with is now moving 29857938475 miles away all b/c of a freaking deadline
fags
////the way you look at me////
gnite darlins
I have work in the am
Well well well
Hahaha!
Jake's directions to the schools LJ account was wrong
You can't trust Jake's directions to his own bathroom in his own dorm room!
Hahaha!
So drop by and tell me what all of you are up to!
I so missed all the cool people I met at SHS!
I've been wondering which aspects of a behavior determine whether it's ritual or rut
And how I can possibly develop more rituals and fewer ruts in my life
This has all come about because lately I've been thinking about the Big Picture
Granted not the global world-issues Big Picture just MY Big Picture
The same thought keeps coming back to me: I lived my first 40 years largely as a leaf blowing about in the wind
it was not self-determined
I want the next 40 years to be lived on purpose
How do I do that?
And how can I start now?
[It makes sense that there is concern for addicts or alcoholics who successfully gets straight or sober some place other than where they live
and then eventually have to return home to old triggers]
So anyway
Ritual
Rut
That and they may not be exactly great for you
I'm not advocating all-structure all-the-time or anything
But I do know the perils of a life devoid of ritual
At least in my experience
I'd like to say that my rituals are more active and crunchy
but alas they aren't (yet)
Here are some rituals I HAVE managed to cultivate:
* Every day when I come home from work the first thing I do is put on my pajamas
Maybe that doesn't sound like a ritual
* Every other Saturday Catharine and I get manicures and pedicures
and we come away with the cutest toes ever!
I've just realized in trying to make a list of my rituals that I really don't have many
How very telling
When I imagine the rituals of others things like a daily morning run (something hard for me to fathom I admit) meditation feeding the ducks on Thursdays after-dinner strolls with your family poker night date night
and the like are what come to mind
Always
and
Is that a rut
or just something totally mental that I do?
Anyway I don't want to sully this post with MY list of rituals and ruts
How do you think we can instill more meaningful rituals into our lives?
From talking with cartoonists I get the sense that most of them find it debilitating too
It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything
- Bart Beaty whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the show from his Conversational Eurocomics column on what SPX could learn from some European conventions
I really enjoyed myself at SPX that delightsome Bethesda megamall of rare and exclusive purchases and the men and women who brought the wares about
That means I didn't see the Ignatz Awards didn't partake of any post-show gatherings and missed a big chunk of panels
Commerce!
Show debuts!
There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot though it wasn't hard to find someone to ask direction of
Still the separation-by-floor carried a certain symbolism for me when coupled with the atmosphere; upstairs was the carnival of monies and tables downstairs were the talks and trophies
Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby
Downstairs there were hushed people crouched before open doors the portals leading to capacity talks
All of it in a building off the highway malls and fences and the whipping metal sea of vehicles all around it
It was a hotel on a road
But we didn't hang around
I also made it a point to say hello to everyone there with whom I'd ever communicated on the internet though I couldn't find anyone matching Johanna Draper Carlson's description and I totally missed Douglas Wolk
To look only at this crowd you'd imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience
I went to two panels Scott McCloud's and Brian Chippendale's
At one point McCloud began vigorously drawing a chart to illustrate different types of artists all the while telling stories of the message board clashes between forces on places like the Comics Journal board
Afterward (a solid half-hour afterward I believe) McCloud could be seen out in the hallway taking questions from anyone who happened to want to talk to him away from the bustle of his table upstairs
BOOKS I GOT:
Abraxas and the Earthman by Rick Veitch (debuted at the show a collection of the Epic Illustrated serial; an additional collection of Veitch's short comics from the same venue is coming soon)
Comics Comics 1-2 edited by Timothy Hodler amp; Dan Nadel (I mentioned this yesterday but didn't note that I also got a hard copy of issue 1)
House of Twelve at the movies Vol
2 1: Heavy Metal by various (from House of Twelve a free giveaway show debut parodying the original movie version of the magazine)
New Tales of Old Palomar 1 (of 3) by Gilbert Hernandez (new miniseries of stand-alone tales presented in the Ignatz format debuting at a show featuring the Ignatz Awards; I remember when this was first released I heard it was going to be titled simply 'New Palomar' like it was New X-Men)
Ninja by Brian Chippendale (debuted at the show probably the book of the show and I've gushed enough already; when I went to Rick Veitch's table he became momentarily transfixed with the transfixed and murmured I want to make a book like this!)
R
Kelly's Trapped in the Closet Starring Batman (Abridged) by K Thor Jensen (a reenactment of the continuing American epic with members of the Batman cast playing each role)
I'm not leveled up yet no sir
Do you know some tiger sharks sleep?
I think it's in the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California I can't remember which but there's so much oxygen in the water they actually sleep
I don't sleep
No it's alright I've had a lot of time to come to terms with this
I just lay in the bed next to them while they snore or they breathe softly or they dream or they do whatever it is sleeping people do
Most of the time I sit in a chair
Because I can't just have a bedroom with bookshelves and dressers or everyone would know something was wrong with me And there is something wrong with me but I just can't figure it out
I just finished a book about the importance of dreams
How important can they be?
I don't have them and I'm still here
Sometimes I can't reading about this condition though
When I was a kid I slept
I think
I don't only feel like the days stretch on interminably
They really do when there's no end
Just me in my room reading my books and wondering what life would be like if I slept
Do I go to work again tomorrow morning?
I think I do
It is isn't it?
I actually keep one everywhere one in my car one in each room of my apartment one in my cubicle
How else would I keep all these days straight?
It's not like a sleep in on the weekend
I can't always read about this condition or whatever it may be
I'm beginning to think there may be nothing to it
I'd tell my doctor but I don't go to a doctor
Otherwise I'm a totally healthy male of my species
Something from when I was a kid
I don't know where that came from
I can drink and drink
Oh I get drunk but nothing seems to happen to me where I forget
Selective memory they say
Most times I can't even remember what I did five seconds ago
Doesn't require much of a brain to do it
Have you ever read it?
I kept having to reread passages until I figured out that it's not chronological
I think he had a point
But I can't remember it right now
I'm at work and I left the book at home
Unless I returned it to the library
I walk to work
When it's nice
It's a couple miles but I don't have a lot of people that I have to rush home to see
Just my books these days
I really need to get more friends
My walk takes me by Lake Calhoun
Most days I look at it as I pass by the fishers the runners the dog walkers
Every so often I walk around it
I don't know what it is about the lake
A shelf of clouds cover the sky and Calhoun choppy from the breeze glitters only slightly
I itch my neck for some reason it itches
Soon the lake will be frozen everyone walking on top of it
I don't get it
Just like the fisherman
Doesn't seem fair not at all
I amble around the lake and the people are slowly thinning out
I on the other hand have nothing to go home to
I should have brought a book with me Then I could read at the lake
And there are plenty of fish
And it's not that cold yet
People stare as I dangle my feet into the lake in October
No one is in the lake and I think everyone thinks something is wrong with me Something is wrong me but I still don't know what
I control it at first
A person walks by me and says something but I don't know what and I'm singing something but I can't place to tune
I think
I could be wrong
But where else would I know it from
Vardaman is right
I just throw my clothes in a pile
I can see people running at me as I dive into Calhoun
For the first time in my life I feel completely normal
I read somewhere that fish don't sleep
Except for some tiger sharks
You're going to hear that a lot from me in the coming weeks I think
What a suck-ass day this turned out to be
Work was fucked up
can I borrow
And now the MAIN instigator in the house has come home
December 1st
Mustkeepeyesonprize
So
This last week at school was nuts- it was the first time that I can remember where I was putting in the hours in the lab really busting my ass- classes are going well and I feel like it all ties in- which I really like
Anyways I'm not sure there's anything else I can add that hasn't been said over and over
Now I'm just trying to take everything one day at a time
My brother turns 16 on Wednesday (howweird)
Last week was so busy that I just TRASHED it
It needs a serious pick up and vacuum
I took Shelby again
she was raring to go
back at the car T had Shelby all wrapped up in a towel to warm her
T started off with Smiley; a 2-3 year-old shepard-pitbull mix
I ran with Smiley this past Wednesday; he was just released (no one came to claim him) and allowed to go for a run
XD
This was the cake
It was fun-filled!
He turned 4!
Just as he was about to blow out his cake
He cried
lol [they are cute brothers no?]
I was scared to see him with a knife
XD
He first tore up the toy car
and I tore up the cake!
:D It was really yummy!
At Work:
This is one of my co-workers grandson
I think he has a crush on me XD
On the way home I picked up my niece Jenny
lt;3
Interact Club - A Day In The Park:
I didn't even think about what I was wearing or anything and just left
XD
Christina's shoe
This is Phi
He looked tired~
Meet Mango!
HAR HAR
This goes to show you have a bigger heart than I Mango dearest
We saw this kid when we were just chillaxing
XDDDD
Oh yeah!~ Our shadows?
We need new ideas
Interact Club - AIDS Walk:
It was like 8 in the morning and so
and so we try to warm up!
Alex you suck
XD
I don't know
Anywho this balloon man was awesome!
I didn't get anything though
Yes there were a lot of heads
Thousands and thousands of people attended
Here we go~!
As we walked
and walked some more
and even more!!
Along the way Christina Kevan Eff and I played the alphabet game like in a gazillion different versions
Two hours with Kevan I should get credit for surviving that long with that nerd
XD
Then we met him
I question that too
I want to go here
because they have a snazzy sign!
This was after we finished a 6 mile walk
Check out the look on Christina's face
XD
Anywho I got really interesting fortunes!
I saw Kathy Vu during the walk!
I haven't seen her in like two years!
Eff likes bunnies
Afterwards we went out to eat with other peoples at Pizza My Heart!
Check out little dao's face
XD
and then meet the nox
Daos you guys complete me XDDDDDD
XD
Everyone else calls him Tony
XD
Interact ended up being a whole ton better than I had expected
I stand barefoot by the ocean's edge my feet sinking slowly being sucked beneath the surface of the cool wet sand
I am planted there
Head tilted back
The sand wrapping my feet is now warmer than the air
Slightly swaying with the breeze I can feel the deep vibration moving through me around me and away
Well here we are again at the conclusion of another all too fleeting weekend
Although my brother likes to point out the fact that every day for me is a weekend
Speaking of time this morning amazon dot com and myself transacted some by business
I ordered the first season of Doctor Who on DVD
I'm sorry but British television rules
Spending quality time with my sister-in-law is different
This coming week I intend to get serious about my real estate venture by establishing a revolving line of credit at the bank
I am actively seeking foreclosures and other deals however if I find one I want to get the financing out of the way to allow me to move quickly
I can't believe it!
It's amazing
Right now we're on a train traveling from Rome to Florence
We'll sightsee there and then take another train to Venice in the evening
We're planning on staying two nights in Venice
From there it's on to Switzerland and then France
Wow
On Friday we saw the Coliseum the Pantheon Trevi Fountain the Spanish Steps Palatine Hill Villa Medici Trinita dei Monti Piazza del Popolo and much more
The Coliseum (or Colosseo) was awesome
Amazing
Yesterday (Saturday) was spent at Vatican City
To enter the Museums it was about a two hour wait
In October the Museums close quite early (1:20pm) so by the time we got in we didn't have a whole lot of time to see things
I would have loved to see the Library but we didn't get to it
Ah well
There was so much to look at I just couldn't take it all in
At all
After eating a quick meal we walked around the outside of the wall trying to find St Peter's Basilica
Didn't have to wait too long though
Inside was stunning- and FULL of people
And then we realized- there was Mass going on!
I can't believe they do that!
It's so rude!
Ah well
Last night we met an Australian couple at our hostel and had a nice chat
You meet a lot of neat people at hostels
There is a pizzeria and gelateria on every corner
Should I take the job Jamie offered me? Should I stay in Salem?
Completely
so I've discovered a new superpowe (and yes I do have others)
keep in mind my bed is lofted about 45 ft high and I was hungover after having slept 4 hours
then my bro calls
I'm too lazy to pick it up
then he calls again and knowing that's the international sign for pick up the frickin' phonei picked it up thinkin' there was something wrong with him
and he's like
are you okay?
I'm like
huh news travels fast
his gf's mom had called him
he called my sister
THEY called me I just wanted to frickin' sleep!
all in all an interesting sunday
yeah
useless day
so I made a martini
that I'm still trying to finish
this fuckers don't go down too easy
hum
definitely in the audible range and very regular
then it would relax again
but yeah
didn't rumble like
say
or how they make them sound in movies
it hummed
Earlier this week Karina had invited me over to her townhouse
I got there a little after 7 Project Runway reruns playing on Bravo and I asked Where's Kubik? because she's usually very punctual
I take a seat in the armchair across from Karina and while she's talking a face appears in the window behind her grinning and waving enthusiastically
Kubik gets a plate for her Chipotle burrito and I ask for tea to dilute the effects of the two cups of coffee I had earlier
Karina prepared a plate of 3 cheeses red peppers crackers and we settle in front of the TV for some Project Runway
This is too intensewith Karina asking if she needs to step outside
Haha except nicer
Sunday afternoon Erica Diana and I are going to the Spy Museum
On the first floor they have a crawlspace you can go through
It's carpeted so not too hard on the knees and I see that someone left behind their brochure
While I'm looking at an exhibit on bugging devices this kid comes up behind me and hands me the pamphlet You dropped this
Later there's a phone booth that rings for visitors to pick up but our timing is never quite right
Diana finds a book and Erica picks up some souvenirs for her family
It was cute
I dipped my finger into the water and she drank the water that collected on it when I put it close to her
Josh aka the creep who I'm in the group with has been tolerable
So we finished the group work and I decided just to head home
There wasn't really nothing on campus I could do that I felt like doing
I did spend some time on the Live Journal looking for pictures/ userpics
Plus
I find myself relating to her alot
LOL
well as normal as it can be
*whispers* especially if I factor Matt into the mix
She is also very strong and keen but carries the scars of her past
Appleseed is another Anime movie I loved
Wish I could get that ESWAT uniform she wears
Matt I actually think you may like this one
So that's what I did for like a half an hour
I decided to get my annual supply of contacts with the knowledge if I did I could get a free webcam and a $30 rebate
The total came to $21892 but it's worth it
I still have a few other appointments
Worked out at the YMCA and took a long relaxing shower after a stay in the sauna
It feels so nice after a long workout
So I stayed at the YMCA for about 2 hours and went home to my little bird
I took out the webcam from Shopko and entered the program into my computer
It works great and I really like it
It's actually something I thought about alot and I did stay dressed up for it
I mean
my guy hasn't seen me for about 4 months so I wanted to look nice
I've always been able to see him if I asked so now he has the option now as well
*smiles* he said I looked cute as always
thanks hun
I'm sorry and I will get more focused
I've not been acting like myself and I know it
So I dedicate this song to you
Artist: Crossfade
Song: Cold
Looking back at me I see
I'm always wrapped up in
Things I cannnot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
And I'm sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
Cause now I can see
You were the antidote that got me by
I never really wanted you to see
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
*smiles* I will beat this thing
*huggles to you all*
Mrangelmeg and I took his cousin Lilli to St Meinrad with us on Friday evening for a couple of functions that happened to be going on that evening in conjunction with this semester's lay student class weekend
The picture is called Exodus and is of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea painted by an Ethiopian artist who currently lives in South Dakota
The other activity was the inaugural session of Theology in the Round a session intended to bring Seminarians Lay Students and Alumni together for an evening of discussion surrounding a topic chosen by a guest speaker
visiting with all my friends who are there for class this weekend while I am not
I do miss them so very much though I don't miss class at all
And we got to see the Extreme Makeover Home Edition house in St Meinrad (the town) as we drove to the Monastery
How cool was that?
And forget the Internet where as much as 75% of all information is general nonsense
Enter stage left: Daniel's Five Minute Guides
1
Gregorian chants were written during these ancient times
2
Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era
3
Baroque (1600-1750): The era of Bach Handel and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today particularly the violin clarinet and piano
4
Just kidding
You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn't know they were writing classical)
They used simple ideas simple textures and simple forms all of which make for great listening material
5
Female composers gained more visibility during this period such as Clara Schumann
6
And anything and everything was possible from atonal to experimental to electronic
7
That was painless wasn't it?
The autoplay in each entry will be set to off but please don't be shy click play!
They talked about how it would be nice if some of the appellate judges understood how farms operate when lawsuits against farmers come up
So I'm leaning slightly in favor although I mostly don't see how it will make that big of a difference
ugh
again kerstin has proven to herself how she isn't who she wants to be yet
:D!
I don't like making decisions b/c I don't want to make the wrong one
there are no wrong decisions only different outcomes! but I can't
and im bound to it
no she's fine
my brother has turned into a pimp from what ive gathered
this amuses me so very much
if you know my brother and his inablility to approach women you'd understand a lot better
yeah he's basically dating three girls in his sophomore class woo~ go jg
college?
my ren
ive successfully installed ilisten so I can literally talk in my essays instead of type them
just a lot of proofreading w/ that approach
and I have my costume but it's a secret ;D
(well mostly two and 1/2 people know)
im pumpkin carving soon so im thinking of doing something simple but effective
ie
the vomiting pumpkin
so easy and cool~ish looking
I miss hugs
(and im not talking about the stalker hugs o_o those do not count) T_T
haven't had any major fights w/ roomies not even small ones
o_O
one last note!
speaking in thrid person amuses kerstin!
:D!
take care guys!
til nxt rambling 
so I had this dream
really
I'm not going to tell you
but its NOT ben
I think I'm finaly over ben
any ways so about my dream
so I was walking next to him and we were looking at one another
and I held my head there for a while
wow this kinda sounds like it going into a porno
far from
infact I'm done
but I was thinking about it alot today
and I ride my horse by his house and even sometimes ride with his dad and last time he came out too
I looked up from my script and thanked him for playing
Ohhe said and smiled
A few seconds later he turned to me and asked Are you going to be here a while?
Ah thanks
I got my violin on tuesday
its a very expensive german hofner model brand new
that and le cygne which is also very easy but just as sophisticated as anything else
le cygne is usually played on cello so just bring it an octave up
cameron wants me to do a radio interview with him on his radio show one night so we'll have to schedule that
I wrote a little bit of my book but not much
of course 2 pages is better than the zero I've been keeping up almost all month
thats all I'm going to mention right now
Dear Marketplace:
I'm an avid listener of the programme
Today though I heard the commentary of Susan Lee
Assumption: That's because Markets[sic] are much better at collecting and evaluating information than anything else on the planet
This depends on what you're measuring
Biodiversity isn't measured because it is more complex than one transaction
It is like throwing everything you eat into a meat grinder
Who is going to buy this sort of prediction and 'futures'?
*The ones in control of it*?
And I do ask who profited from 9/11 in the first place?
Yes Ms Lee mentions insurance
Look into it
The answers are dispicable
Comment: Traders those who buy and sell the contracts bring all their disparate information on the political situation in Saudi Arabia into this central marketplace
Would Ms Lee be throwing out these ideas for the US elections?
Maybe it's time to add one more weapon to the arsenal
Maybe it isn't!
Joementum manages to dive on the recent threat-ish that emerged from Britain and turn it all around to make a comment on Ned and the democrats
That's why they went for the British airports
This is how the redcoats see the world
The terrorists want us out of Iraq
As long as terrorists exist we can't get out of Iraq
As long as there are any terrorists anywhere doing anything we can't pull out
The state of Iraq what the Iraqi people want all of that jazz it's never spoken of at times like these
All that matters is that terrorists want us out of Iraq so that means we have to stay
Then Holy Joe ripped this one out:
Joe you're scraping
You're turning redcoat
Then I wake up
The Getty Museum in LA stems from his collection
They have several Degas
and Rembrants
and Monets
and Reniors
and Titians
and Van Goghs
Now understand when it comes right down to it I am a hick from the sticks
I had never before seen a work by any of the Masters - the closest I have ever gotten to a Michelangelo is watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
A real Alma-Tadema
They didn't like me very much
Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting
Well I'm getting to that!
Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting
Another femur
A femoralacetabular joint
A glenoid-humoral joint) Some of the exhibits were very interesting such as the soccer player and the skateboarder
Seeing the body in action was very interesting
Now people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book
They have the blood vessels of various limbs that have been injected with polymers so that you can witness the intricacies of the blood supply
The basic anatomy and bodies in motion portions are a must see
Just thought I'd let you know
:p
I'm still being bothered by the craziest smells
I'm also constantly congested and I've been having drainage in my throat
My energy level is starting to increase more and more
Since school is just starting we've been eating a lot and it's funny because they are letting me get away with going first saying I am eating for two
no we're not considering Johnny as a name!)'
Alright we're about to eat dinner so until next time
Jessica and Scott are outside on the porch playing a card game together
It hasn't been very eventful in any way
Besides Hitler
or George Bush
or somebody like that
He keeps yelling and pounding his feet on the floor
Cold with cocktail sauce?
To which my brother said Cocktail
That's what I think
As you can tell my day has been nothing short of tremendous
It looks like somebody puked up several golds and pinks and then pasted it on a canvas
I just want
I dont even know
anyways
I'm out
Later
It wasn't because I was sad though
I looked over at Jon and I said Hey I feel like I'm going to pass out
I woke up to Jon picking up my head and saying my name but I couldn't hear him
Hey!
I know I have not been writing 4 a long time
I was studying 4 my CT3
Anyway a few weeks ago I visited a chinese tea house and ate mooncakes and proper tea and tea eggs
I will never try one again and I suggest you do the same
I had rockwall enrichment yesterday
It started raining jus B4 it started
Luckily it stopped in time for the lesson
Bye
So I started work Weds
That was uhm harsh?
I'm being trained by this woman her name is Judy
Not to mention I find her to be incredibly intimidating(surprise?)
Anyway as the day proceeded it seemed to be getting easier and I was so sure I had the basics down pat
I felt this way up until it was time to count my drawer
The second day I went in and I was so paranoid
OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything
The end of the day came and it was than time to count out my drawer
Today (day three) went relatively smoothe
at the end of today my drawer was exact again
Tomorrow I have to go in at 8 and stay till 5pm
That is going to suck so much
Urrr two more hours gt;lt; Ahh than for this coming week they have me down for nearly everyday till closing time
Hopefully tomorrow will go smoothe
I'm definately done bitching for now
Buh byeee
Another little check-off on the to-do list as all three of my summer classes are now done and graded and I still retain my 40 GPA
Thus Statistics mandatory Spanish and the public speaking class I've been in this summer were the three classes I've assumed were most likely to potentially drop my GPA
It's why I try to hone my body as I do my mind
I have a month off of classes now to do research and move and probably take up an internship job
Life keeps moving
I sent the last one that came around off with such a red face it was a wonder he didn't pass out!
I wonder if its faded yet
He called me a woman
I don't look that much like a girl do I?
Seven hours on the road in two days and I've come to the conclusion that most people have no concept of what turn signals speed limits and restroom sinks are for
I stopped in New Gloucester to use the bathroom on the turnpike and had to wait because it was so busy
All told about a dozen guys and I was the only one who actually washed his hands
There wasn't even a cursory pretend wash amounting to little more than a cold water rinse
Some were in the middle of eating others were holding girl's hands or their children
Wash your damned hands
I didn't see much of Michael he had to work during the day then Holly and I skipped out to see a movie and left him with the kids
You know it's like the Airport Mall here in Bangor: the automatic doors for instance aren't necessarily automatic anymore
The theater itself hasn't been updated since approximately ET was first released
It makes me appreciate the local cinemas that much more (the former) Hoyt's and even the cheap seats at Spotlight in Orono all have the new stadium seats bigger screens and latest sound tech
But it was nice to get out to the movies with Holly I don't get to see her very much at all in any role other than as mom and as a single male with no kids it's hard to associate myself with parents
I have no clue
What do I do when someone three feet tall smacks me in the head?
But unlike that said territory children grow-up at some point and most at least realize that you can't just go around pissing people off
Though they undoubtedly do
The movie itself sucked
Tricky bastards
But this one was just full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through
Ok so at one point they find a dead moose in the middle of the cave system
How did it get there?
Umm-kay I can see that
But on each side of this cavern there are drop-offs of hundreds of feet that had to be traversed by clinging to the ceiling
So how the holy fuck did the cave-dwellers get a MOOSE through?
And what about the primitive cave paintings by the local natives thousands of years ago?
How did they traverse the chasms?
Would they bother?
You explore for a little bit then WHOOPS!
No floor!
Is your first thought well must find a way across?
What about the tiny passages you'd have to squeeze through?
What's the point?
Fresh water?
Safety?
So what's the point?
After the movie and the subsequent discussion as to all the different ways it was just simply retarded we came back to the house and watched TiVo
We also caught a couple episodes of that new Stan Lee show about the wanna-be super heros on SciFi
I'm already convinced that Feedback will win he just looks the part of a modern comic book figure
Comics and subsequent spin-off media such as movies reflect the point I'm making: the whole shebang has gotten darker both literally and figuratively
Yea ok so I don't know what this has to do with the refrain but it's a catchy tune
Then I head home around lunch time
It was so packed that all three lanes were barely crawling along at the speed limit let alone any faster
Imagine: three lanes of traffic none of it moving for the better part of two hours
Got into Bangor picked up my check went home and waited for Erin
How can I blog so extensively at work?
The new guy is still training and since he goes live on his own next weekend he needs to ensure he can actually do the job on his own
Yes in effect I've become a Supervisor
Sniff
Fosse's career was never the same
Teams---1---2---3---4---5---6----Final
Nick------1---0---1---12--2---2----18
Marco----2---2---1---1---7---0----13
Well it was an all right game
Let's just say they gave us at least five outs but probably more
The inning would just never end
I had quite a few homeruns and was involved on the wrong side of a great defensive play turned in by Joe Twarogowski
Joey who was blocking home plate reached up and snared the ball as I arrived at the plate
Upon hitting the ground he pulled the ball out of his glove and into his bare hand and showed everyone he had held on to complete the double play
When I asked him whether he was all right he said he was and proceeded to tell me that he knew it was coming
He saw the play unfolding but had no way to brace for it because of the high throw and the simultaneous arrival of me and the ball
Pete Rose scores the game-winning run and Ray Fosse the Indians' seemingly promising beacon is never the same ball player
Joe was fine after taking one of the hardest shots any catcher has ever taken in the six years we've been playing ball together
Yes injuries can happen but as a former catcher it's the most exhilarating play in sports
Joe said it doesn't happen that often so it doesn't bother him
It's not as if Joe has never gotten me before
I remember it as though it were yesterday
June 5th 2003
We were intentionally walking Ahsan to load the bases up
I screamed for Billy to throw it and he did
I landed by the ball and picked it up with my bare hand
Ahsan says he still remembers that play
He saw us sprawled out on the ground and thought for sure Joe was out
I remember walking off the field disgusted with myself
It was as if they had won the World Series
They completely mobbed Joe and were bounding around home plate as if Joe were the king of baseball
All right that's all I want to say
My brother and I just went out to go for a bike ride
I checked my bike tire and though it was quite bent and warped I was still able to go biking
What I did to see was check to see what my balance was
It was 62 dollars that's precisely 56 dollars more than I had
Scott moved out this morning
I was sad but I helped him move his stuff
Despite the large load of stuff he took I barely notice a difference in the house
The place looks just as full as it did when he was living here
I've already told mom I'm moving on the weekend of the 26th and I just need to get a hold of Andrea so I can make the plans formal
I could probably find a way to swing it but it would be a little cramped
I also tried to do my timetable today was the first day I can set the timetable
That way I can go to the Furmeets Jason also did the same thing he has Mondays off so he can go to the furmeet
Woohoo!
I need to make another few calls but mom's in Norwich and has the only phone that works right now
I also have my MoCoMotion password and username right here not to mention my OSAP access number and all the numbers I need to call right here with me I am PREPARED
well I could splurge
and they say for this semester I only owe them 104412
So tomorrow I am busy
Sam and I are both working for Burgessville Rocks for Whitney
Alphabeta for two years and now this
Try to tell me that it's not impressive to see on a resume
Which I should print up next week when I find the time after I get the info
I need to have them ready so I can be looking for a job In Brantford after school
None of that for the Runa
I am looking to drive more so I can get my G2 I am solid in my belief that I am going to Brantford on the 26th I am no longer indecisive I want to get away from the issue between my parents and I am looking to be very assertive for college
Here's a list of the things I need to do
I need to do that ASAP
4 move to Andreas and get comfortable there while looking for an after school job
5 talk to the people concerning the shuttlebus from Brantford to Mohawk
So tomorrow's gonna make me a little sad
Not to mention the 680
I will be okay until I move to Andreas and for a little while afterwards I'm in no rush but I want to be ahead of the crowd
You know do my thing be independent
I know I CAN do it I just want college that's my thing
I mean I told her on July 25th or somewhere around there that I'd come help out and I wasn't backing out this time
Plus I get to see Whit Sam Will and the whole High School Crew
I miss em all and they're the smartest most responsible group I've ever been a part of
I will be on all night waiting
Flamers
Not flamboyant Homosexuals but people on message boards and forums
People like a guy I know named Pisher and Kuellere
Both are people who go on the Boxofficemojo forums
Just as an example here's something he wrote
It's a defensible opinion however unproven
So sorry to have misunderstand you it would help if you learned how to write
just because they can
despite the fact that it made nearly 200 million dollars
Well I'm gonna go post on a board and try to ignore the flames
so im confuzed
I dont know what I want outta life
im only writing this stuff down because when I see it in writing sometime I understand myself better
freaky
or even enough of those?
I suck completely and thouroughly suck
I feel like I constantly need a boyfriend
I cant learn to be ok with myself alone and I dont want to have to rely on boys to make me feel like im important or worth living
I want to be that
Do you people not listen to the news or what?
I just can't believe it
I'm only going back now should a member of my immediate family pass away
For ages now I've been doing this self defence class and at the beginning of every class we get a stern talking too about not doing any of this stuff at home and I've just discovered why
So now I have five staples in the back of my head
Which just so you know really fucking hurts
(Click here for full story)
We have spent billions of dollars and countless human capital expenditure on the whole Homeland Security division
Honestly I think it means that we will be SAFER for the next few months traveling
It's the pervasive spread of Big Brother Is Watching You that concerns me Some people say we only have to put up with this for two more years while I say Get me a job in Canada!
Two wrongs can make a right in small situations
Plausibility deniable
This works in their favour
It can also be turned against them
I'm currently at Willprint with Cam-cam and Meggie
Some questions wasn't even discussed
Plus that theories and galaxies
fuck I can't wait to live alone!
what the helllll
im cleaning out my inbox and saved folders and stuff too
hahah
so much old stuff
I went delving into my old entries and comments and stuff today
I used to be so sad about it
I still have moments and all natrually
that's one of the last steps
when you come to terms with letting it go
most people say that's the first step but it totally isn't
euphoric almost
wowo
I'm so deep
deep like the kiddy pool
I am back from vacay
we're down to the final weeks of summer people!
even though I know inside that I could beat them at most aspects of all that
Maybe if I just tried hard enough without anyone putting me down
I could do it
My brain seems dead and most probably won't be able to keep up with everything else that I'm sure is going to be thrown at me If people's minds could be weirded out
I wish it all would end
I don't like that
Then they are gone
You can only savour them for that moment
Miss it and that is it
Back then everything was simple
Why is life so much more complex now
What is it that I want out of my life
Where should I go on from here
Questions only questions with no answers
3rd guy sms-ed me 3 times in 3 days time
I gave in to temptation
Was this how Eve felt when Satan tempted her with the forbidden fruit
I replied him asking him to give me a call which he did
We chatted for a while
He told me about his work and his regime for his upcoming marathon
I do not agree with her as my basic needs are not fulfilled yet
I have yet to establish a career for myself
There are still hundreds and one things that I want
Fui al dentista hoy
I got three cavities
THREE
Have to go back ( I shrug at the thought)
Well ni modo
Have to have healthy teeth
right?
My parents are moving to Mars Pennsylvania on Thursday
Mars
This is twenty minutes from Pittsburgh where my dad works but still 6-7 hours from Swarthmore where I go to school
Win win!
He won't have to commute across three states anymore but it'll still be a hassle for anyone to visit me or to plan for me to get home
I spend my time joyfully packing boxes
It's like Christmas presents in reverse
Probably I do
But I've spent the last three years trying to cut off any contacts or feelings of mine to this town
I went to a bar last night on my way home and had a drink amp; a sandwich
A guy sat next to me and bumped my leg with his
I talked to the bartender for a minute
Really?
Yeah
Hahaha!
Yeah)
He looked high
Attractive and high
I performed the standard get-lost-loser body language
I'm going to start saying things like Sorry I'm moving to Mars
Just because you know too cheesy to live
Also Mormons came to the door last week
I invited them in and ended up with lots of pamphlets amp; the book of Mormon
I'm not sure why I did that or why I allowed that to happen or whatever
Maybe I wanted to fuck with myself which usually happens anytime I feel relatively okay
They were so earnest
Maybe I was nostalgic
I need to go to therapy like whoa
so much has happened since the last time I updates
39 kids 4 leaders 1 amazing Irish woman named lynn and 3 weeks in england ireland and wales can only lead to a once in a life time experience
at first I wasn't convinced that I would literally make friendships to last a life time but that changed as soon as we got on the plane
so I came back right in time right before heathrow airport was put on severe high alert
lets just say I never want to drive a manual car again
It's not like much has happened since last year
or maybe there has been
There is always so much stuff I have to do each day that before I know it the day is gone
I think so far the city has really opened my mind up to certain things
The people here even at Columbia are so different than I expected
My Marketing Strategies class always keeps me thinking about it
Today I exchanged numbers with a girl in my class so we can study for our Midterm
One of the girls who is also in my class was in the elevator
The weirdest part is her roomate is someone who I went to school with since jr high
This weekend I'm going to see Beck
that is if my ticket ever comes
Have lots of prescriptions and mental helath appointments to look forward to but hopefully things will get better soon
I am still having trouble walking straight and am slurring a lot (so excuse the grammar) but things are getting better
Had loads of tests including a catheter due to my not being able to urinate
My night last night turned out amazing towards 8:00-9:00
I had a really nice conversation with Juckett another amazing one with Phil and then another one with Solomon
I turned the channel to ESPN because the DirectTv satellite guide said NFL Live was on
Instead of NFL Live I get Barry Zito of the Oakland A's rambling on about somebody who just died
Jacked Up?
Definitely

I just watched Kinsey
I told mom I am paying rent she said no you arent!!
I just plainly said :
she stopped talking about it started mumbling about porcaline and what time she has to start the bisk
I dont want her to think that I will never take her suggestions as useful or necessary because I cant say that wont happen
not on this matter however
I never took it out
the key bank woman reassured me that the BRINKS people when they find cards that dont belong to key bank shred up the cards!
their atm machines eat the cards
so no one can get the card!
and therapy!!
I dont!
and me with my explaining skills wont show her how what she just said stung!
thus getting myself more pissed and less willing to finish what I was just trying to say
which in turn gets a scough and a look that says maybe you should just go to bed
therapy
no not that long
lets face it
I'm not going anywhere
okay shut up!
Okay y'alls
So I'm sitting here with chapped lips
I went to the dentist today was some fillings and instead I got a root canal

First they gave me a swab to numb my gums then two shots
Annnndddd
And a temp
filling which sucks
we've been able to sponge bandwidth off someone somewhere for the past few days
so hi friends it is me and I'm in my sweatpants and barefoot
tres lux as compared to going out in public
pshaw!
ok so do me a favor?
go to designhergalscom and tell me if you think I should get some business cards from them
I made a girl that I think looks like me dressed her in a pink jacket with ballet flats and put a cupcake in her hand
my spendy muscles are like twitching in anticipation but I don't know
should I come up with something on my own?
except no cos she's thinking about going to school for nursing and I've been knitting like a mofo
do these people know who I am?
no way
Sunday night the evening he had spoken to Schuldig over the phone was the one night that Brad had actually slept well
He had wanted to call either Yohji or Schuldig last night but Deguchi had kept him busy attending a ball not returning home until three in the morning
At least they hadn't needed to be anywhere until lunch this morning
And Deguchi didn't have another social function planned until tomorrow night
It was merely golf all day tomorrow and then the party that night
And then the flight home
And Brad couldn't wait to get home
He just hoped that Yohji had time to talk
Dear Dinah 
Oh it's so soon now so quick
This is the last day
I didn't go to Speech this morning because there was nothing else for me to turn in
I didn't find any but did find a five-dollar bathing suit
Not fashionable but it fits/was five dollars
Even Aaron played although he hadn't signed up
Mez got a waffle-iron
I got 24 shades of 80s-colored eyeshadow
It was very bright
We offered to do Aaron too but he just laughed and shook his head
He really laughed a lot today
Pacheco asked me to sign his yearbook and he signed mine
I made me sorry that I don't actually know him
The bell for last hour had already rung and we were talking to a bunch of Ryan's popular football-friends
SorryexcusemeI'msorryIjustneed-
As Mink turned from his locker and slid through the crowd Ryan watched him go
Ryan nodded
Yeah
I know
What for?
Well he was in my ICP class sophomore year
So we just did that
To him
For like a week
Because all those things about Mink are exactly the reason why I can't well can't anything really
And that's total bullshit because those things shouldn't even matter
It's about a fucking jacket
Only maybe just in different ways
There are several things I know
And also I look like a cat
Backing out of that driveway getting further and further away from you was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do
Getting home- back to reality
Now I have to unpack
anyways I wont b here all weekend I will b in penn state with a bunch of male bleeders and my brother lol so there ttyl byes
Well you know
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
Don't you know you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright Alright
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're all doing what we can
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be alright
Alright Alright
Well you know

Alright Alright

Karl Marx was onto something
Not exactly how anyone wants to go out
Stiffer than a starched Eton collar
Welcome to the future and recent past
It will take total deprogramming
It will take an exit from the current compromised system
Programming In Action
Like other socialists Marx and Engels sought an end to capitalism and the systems which they perceived to be responsible for the exploitation of workers
- from Wikipedia
I was led through an interesting internet surfing session to a full-on philosophical debate between members of these two camps in which it appears as though the Leninist scored a numbing defeat
Perhaps
We are a nation of air-conditioned drive-thru frequenting automatic can-opener using processed meat-eating hands-free restroom-using workers
We live to work but work is not our collective life
Most of us do not choose to work
We work because the system demands that we operate the machinery
That's the American Dream
Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything
I don't want you to write to your Congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write
You've gotta say I'm a human being goddammit!
So I want you to get up now
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs
and I'm not going to take this anymore!!

So I started my first job this week
Yeah I know I'm 19 but I never worked
I volunteered at a store once but that was about it
I was more tired because I was used to sleeping in until like 10 but now I have to wake up at 7
The job is really nice
She actually knows a couple of people that I know
Today sucked
Again
Ugh
I just don't get it
I'm just such a complete airhead
It just feels like my brain has ceased to function
Or like there like fluff in it instead of a brain
'eeh
okaaay then
' and continues talking to someone else
And then worst thing is? I don't DO anything about it
(Why yes I have in fact spent the rest of the day imagining paint-based emergencies
At once!)
Ahem
I checked two poltergeist books out of the library today
Yeah
EWWW
Well if you do remember that catchy song?
You know Easy?
By a band called Big Country
Okay if you're going to be cooler than anyone saying that you're cooler than my mom is a fucking given
He told me she has conversations with his away message online
[self-explanatory]
Very odd and peculiar
You choose the answer
My first day at Banana Republic is actually going to be this Saturday not Sunday
Some chick named Monica called and asked if I could work
Sure
No pun intended
Get a fucking clue
Lame lame lame comparison I know
But a video like that has to be stuck in there somewhere
Well
I listened to a few of them
The closest to the origanal is Panic!s cover on This is Halloween
There are so many things that never make it past the filter into this blog
I am never totally sure who is reading (people who don't have time or inclination to comment?
That and time
I tend to have great ideas about commentary about midday and don't get around to blogging until later and the mood has passed
And you can bet I gave it a lot of thought
So we are
Update:
Eric:
first let me say this is one of the stupidest fucking reasons to be (once again) pissy with someone
Fucking seriously kid
This was on myspace today
So I've stopped listening
I attempted to have a normal conversation with him and apparently my basic human right to hang up whenever I choose to do so Is not allowed
No more
I dressed conservatively and had no idea what I was doing
Long story short I learned a lot
The results: Careless Driving (required when you hydroplane) and 2 points on my driving record and 60 dollar fine
Every one was really nice even the judge
I get 9 in one yr and ive never had a ticket before so I will be fine
So I pulled over and ran up
I walked up to him Whats going on you need some help?
He said yah
I backed up during all this and looked under the vehicle only to see flames roaring towards the gas tank
after though I was thinking about it it would have been kinda cool to get interviewed for pulling him out
I dont think I saved his life but I may have saved his legs and a lot of skin
Who knows
I remain anonymous in the newspaper and life goes on
Poor kid though
An honesty
Anyways Life goes on
And I've been thinking my earlier comment about how this stuff finds me Many people drove past and many cars were infront of me in that exit lane maybe this stuff is just as equally around everyone I only choose to stop
but If it was more discrete and people only saw the car in the ditch or only saw me take out the sign how long would it have taken someone to stop?
How many people a day drive by cars with hadards on or sitting n the side of the road
He didnt even get my name but Im sure he will not forget me
K enough with that kinda thought
It was SOOOO nice to see them
Just what I needed to collect myself and continue home
Novmber 11th is the next time I will for sure be there for the weekend I have courtney and im coming down early to stay at scotts
He does not know this yet I need to call him this week
I can't wait to go on a night drive with Brian and just chill out there for awhile
But Maria does not want me too so Paul came in for me My finger needs to get better faster
Typical day I suppose
Yesterday was eventful today is relaxing
Im going to mail grandma a letter tonight
She will be just fine
I know noone who reads this besides myself so it does not matter
no goal tonight
Just go with the flow
And not even that I can't relate or try to
I just don't
What also started me thinking like this is the whole dating issue
There are not a lot of guys that I will go for
say
- I don't think it's okay to display women provocatively everywhere just to sell a product
Go ahead care about the environment but don't care about demeaning women)
- I don't drink excessive amounts to project an image of being cool
I don't drink excessive amounts because I am bored
- I listen
- I actually take notice of nice days smells etc and appreciate it appreciate the luxuriousness of things like that and let it effect me I don't just trample it in my Uggs
- I try not to listen to rap because it perpetuates stereotypes
- I don't say like every other word
Nor do I continually inflect the ends of my sentences upwards
I could go on
Meh
Its not my bag and I don't really even want to be around it
What is so wrong about REMEMBERING the weekend?
Please if you exist anywhere let me know!
All of my co-workers are people like that
So I did and then the second dog growls at me too and Im likeShould I run or keep walking?
So I kept walking and then the other dog that crossed the street comes back running at me and I said OHH SSHHIITTT!!!
And I saw a house with the gate door opened slightly and I squeezed in there sumhow sumway!!!
WITH MY BACKPACK ON ME!!!
So yeah I stayed in that house for like three minutes then I got up and checked to see if the dogs were gone and they were so I tried squeezing out the same way I squeezed in but I didnt fit so I just opened the door and left
I WUZ SCARED!!!
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow 
-The Rose
Bette Middler
There is a prospect and I think I am going to go for him
I think I will wake from the dream and I will see if I cannot turn it into a reality
I did an SAT Lit practice test on each bus ride because I am cool and I did better than I expected
If you haven't heard them search iTunes and download the Podcast
The staff is currently in the process of archiving every one of these 30-45 second clips ever made so I spent almost all day going through them
I had to listen to each fully and make note of any audio or labelling defects and whether there was an advertisement at the end
I totally loved it because I am a geek
At first I thought that someone had inexplicably decided to RV in the middle of Broadway but a man with a French accent told me it was for a Will Smith movie
I went out to Starbucks for lunch
**As in Farrell I assume
Funny she usually thinks I'm Nora
Hey all 
I got a call this morning asking me to come in for an interview today at 1:30pm
I was psyched
ugh
I went back had 6 mins to go get it and get back to the bus stop
I got it got back to the station and my bus came right away
I got on the bus dropped my resume on the wet floor and almost dropped my mp3 player
So I tried to relax on the bus on the way
When I got there I went in and told them I was there and waited
They told me that they would set me up for the next interview by calling me in the next day or 2
The next interview is with the general manager of the store it will likely take place on Saturday
The 2 interviewing me were thinking of placing me in digital imaging due to my background with photography and video editing I told them that it would likely turn out to be too easy for me in the long run and that I was hoping for a position more challenging so that I could learn more overall
I said that I want to work in the TV department as I want to learn more about them
Oh if I get a job at Futureshop It looks like I would be starting there around November 8th
We'll see how things go
My plans coming up
Tomorrow: Gotta go to MDG for the last time to pick up my paycheck for that week and a half I was there
Friday: Going to a movie or 2 with Paul at Rainbow cinemas
Saturday: Hopefully the interview at futureshop
Oct 21st: If I'm free I want to check out Brad Sucks live in concert
I would try to do some video too
That is all for now 
So yeah I did
The night before I was really
Seriously
Okay
So that night I decide
Hmm I remember Gareth's password why don't I spy to see whats going on
I never would do that but I had to because I was speculating about the whole thing
So I did and I got so panicy that I only got to the 6th page
and I was freak it
So
Really scared
So he kinda knew something was wrong
So I did anyway
in a WORD document
and he said that it was understandable
And he said I gave you my password for a reason so we wouldn't have to keep secrets from each other
Majorly
Then
And I was like
Well if you want
But I was like Do what you want
He's like yeah he would wait a couple of weeks and delete her
but it happened
because then afterwards I had a BIG HEADACHE!
But I feel okay
Ehh
it's a little more complicated
have u ever been chased with a knife?
so I ain't much to prove
