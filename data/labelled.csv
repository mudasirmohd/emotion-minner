And let me tell you how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city and Germany as a nation,joy
Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup,anger

And for what it's worth I agree with them it makes me nervous too,fear

And then we watched in amazement with fifty other tourists as the sun went down in front of the temple over the Mediterranean,joy
And of course this just enhanced the magic of the sunset as the red orb of the sun ever so slowly retreated behind the furthest hill,joy
Not bad,anger
We saw Jessica's production of Medea and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival,joy
They did everything they could to make us feel welcome everything from putting us up in a beautiful hotel refusing to let us pay for anything and making sure that our stay on their island was as enchanting as the stories always make it out to be,joy

Tomorrow we'll go somewhere special,joy
The next morning the last day of the festival they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles and took us off the map to an area that I will henceforth be labeling The Blue Lagoon,joy
Imagine the most incredible horseshoe shaped cove with unimaginably blue water and a giant stone underneath the water hundreds of meters long and wide adding depth to the color,fear

But we didn't let that discourage us,sadness
We went on a walking tour went to the City Museum (located in an old castle very cool) and had a good time relaxing and enjoying the AMAZING views,joy
The city is incredibly beautiful tucked into the Alps and right on the water,joy
I think the most important thing I can say about this city is that all of the rumors: That the city's dirty the people are rude the language barrier is insurmountable the metro is incomprehensible you things will be stolen that they hate Americans,anger
It's called the city of love and light for a reason,joy
The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing,joy
The people are absolutely LOVELY,joy
We encountered so many genuinely wonderful helpful content people,joy

Every night after dinner we'd climb the hill to the cathedral and sit on the steps,joy
The Cathedral is the highest point in Paris and from its northerly vantage point you have the entire city spread out at your feet,joy
It's a pretty breathtaking sight,joy
On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit,joy
Those evenings on the steps are some of my favorite memories from Paris,joy
Upon arrival back in the states we changed clothes and went directly to a Counting Crows concert which was my birthday present from Lance,joy
What an incredible end to an incredible journey,joy

This is my first year of loving myself,joy
I look forward to learning and discovering even more of who I am and loving every inch of it,joy
I cannot believe the nerve of this man God,joy
kill something,sadness
What's even worse it's copied so poorly that the last half inch of text on the far right side of the page is cut off so as I try to read in preparation for the lab tomorrow I'm trying to coherently complete sentences and make sense of it all which is often impossible because so much is left out,sadness
AND we're required to have this new kind of remote control clicker which none of the libraries have for (free) check out so I have to pay $20 (+$1250 activation fee) for something that doesn't work consistently eats batteries and will provide me with 3 and a half months of use,joy

I am in such a bad mood and I'm playing the blame game in my head getting angry at people for things that are really quite trivial,anger
Matt and I decided that BME really isn't a good undergrad major there's a reason it's generally proposed as a Master's degree,joy

Should I start devoting myself to God if there is such a being in hopes of making it to Heaven?,joy
No wonder past writers were able to produce their amazing feats of feeling and thought,joy
Their distractions were very limited,anger
My thoughts at the moment are somewhat melancholy but can be completely forgotten at the push of a button mounted to an Xbox Dvd player or VCR,sadness
For the laziness in me I feel compelled to fold my laptop plug it in and simply watch but this whole trainwreck a malformed offspring of a feeble mind has to come to an end somehow,fear
The first words that come to mind are in closing or to conclude and then I quickly write a summary of what I just finished writing,anger

what is happiness,joy
I believe all brains start out with the same potential and the way they are grown and shaped determined how they operate on default for the rest of your life unless you do something about it,sadness
Do they know how lucky they are - to find contentment without looking,joy
more often you find things to bring you down or worry about,sadness
A single lightning bolt from the sky can make a lifetime of panic and worry all worthless,fear
True wisdom is growing your brain in all directions,joy
Life is finding the balance between compulsion and carelessness,anger
I am not saying I am anything other then happy - but I strive for a balance,joy
the perfect combination of all attributes,joy
Happiness comes from within - your brain is a self regulating chemical factory,joy
This phenomenon can best be seen and proved with steroid users,joy
as a result - the balls shrink up and shut down,sadness
The body is lazy - if you provide something for it - it stops providing for itself,joy
So while Cliche it is true,joy
Happiness lies within - the only way to be truly happy is to create it yourself and not rely on other people or things,joy
the Happiness they bring is only temporary,joy
Yet often that temporary happiness is more intense then a balanced contentment,joy
It is however usually accompanied by and equal sadness - it is life's way of balancing itself out in the endless pendulum swing of life,sadness
First she is all mad because I haven't called her back in a week,anger

Our emotions are a gift from God,joy
But in order to recieve the blessing we must first realize that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet,joy
By listening to our emotions and asking ourselves why we are feeling a particular emotion we can discover an unmet need or a need that has been satisfied,joy
On the otherhand if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then my need for connection has been met,joy
How many times have we felt angry and as a result insulted judged criticized blamed or physically hurt someone?,anger
We live in a society that has encourages us to stuff our emotions and a society that is by the most part feelings illiterate,disgust
Well for starters become aware of what we are feeling,joy
Once we put our finger on the emotion we are feeling we can then go on to vocalize it,joy
Part of that model involves asking the question I am feeling _______ because I am needing ______,joy
The idea is that Nonviolent communication which focuses on feelings and needs is the language of the heart because it focuses on what is alive in the heart,joy
By stating our feelings and needs to others we avoid blaming and criticizing them,fear

When others are angry or upset with us we can also use this technique on them,anger
We can ask them Are you feeling ______ because you are needing _______?,joy
It may be that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict,fear
For instance if we feel furious it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down,anger
Many times in the past we have reacted like a lion when we feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves,anger
Taking time to focus on our feelings and needs helps us not let the lion out and speak from the heart that language of the giraffe with ourselves and others,fear

I called Dad a few minutes ago on my cell and they were at her house so I guess she was out of the hospital,surprise
I need to clean my room up but I don't feel up to it,joy
I don't know why I'm just drained of energy and want to cry constantly and for somereason I don't know why,sadness
I don't know what happened to my happiness I woke up feeling down and miserable and infact it's worse,sadness
I'm losing enjoyment out of things I love to do and thats never a good sign,joy
I don't even feel like doing anything right now and I'm having force myself to update this journal,anger
The conversation was funny I mentioned that if the word got out about our plans we'd have to escape the earth to avoid the police HOLY/HOLD the military and etc and yeah XD JC suggested she could try and make a ship but then I suggested we could sneak into NASA and steal a rocket,fear

But not something to be taken literally we're just insane girls,anger

Cassy said she'll be back Sunday night,anger
I can live with that I wish I had something to do though_; I feel lonely,anger
It's yet another white man insensitivity subject that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying 'hey hold on a second!',joy
I see the words veil and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts,anger
Whether the French will ever admit it or not they have a serious racism problem - and its aimed mainly at Muslims and Africans,sadness
The Germans have passed similar laws much to the dismay of its large Turkish-Muslim population,anger
The Brits famous for their true melting pot status amongst the Europeans have began treading in this murky water,joy
The well integrated but edgy Muslim community is not so happy about this,joy
And I'm afraid it could get ugly,fear
It shouldn't he added be decided by a group of old white male politicians,joy
Most of the European peasantry covered themselves with a headscarf just a hundred years ago and can still be found in christian villages throughout eastern and southern europe,joy
It is also true that many Muslim cultures in the world 'oblige' their women to wear the veil,joy
France says no head scarves no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out,anger
It is Europe's largest 'indigenous' Muslim population all of whom are white Europeans and embrace European principles,joy
The Muslims too have yet to seriously address the fears and concerns of 'indigenous' white westerners - who have opened their doors from some of the worlds worst economically and socially oppressed societies,joy
Muslims too need to understand the fears and concerns of secular westerners who now have to deal with strict Islamic rules within their own communities,joy
There is no black and white my friends,joy
Essentially Christian is toggling with what direction musically he wants to pursue (whether that be skyline or not) whereas in light of the confustion I (Mike) have decided to leave the project,surprise
It was not on any bad terms and to be honest I don't know if there still is a Skyline to speak of but as those of you who know US know that I'm pretty focused and content with where I am heading and I've definately got my own timetable in which I plan to do it,joy
The one bad thing is that she got news this morning that her 21 y/o kitty Aunt Becky passed away last night,anger
She knew the kitty was not doing well (she hasn't been for a while now but kept rallying) so it wasn't a shock at all but still sad,anger
She had been looking at having to have her PTS before she leaves for Africa but I guess Aunt Becky had other ideas,surprise
I think Aunt Becky was waiting for my MIL to leave yesterday for her trip here,surprise
Aunt Becky was sent over the bridge in a traditional Anishinaabe (Ojibwe/Chippewa) ceremony,joy
Aagii my MIL's neighbor is of the Bear Clan and is very traditional in her ways,anger
She wrapped Aunt Becky in ceremonial cloth with 4 different herbs and buried her down by the creek that runs behind their homes in Topanga Canyon,sadness
Daddybear refused to let them take the baby!,joy

Well the new dog; Louis went running out onto the patio and barking up a storm as I stuck my head out there sat this stupid young dude trying to break into my neighbor's (across the street) car,surprise
So I called the cops and followed him till he went into the dark then I left it to the cops,sadness
911 operator asked Is it a white guy or a latin guy,joy
so I gave her the real description; a young black male with short dreads and dark clothes and shoes,sadness
One cop came he talked to me for two seconds and then drove down the street a second,fear
This time unfortunately he'd broken INTO the car already and was fishing things out,anger

It's a beautiful thing,joy
=o) Although I feel like I've been on a really bad episode of 'Law amp; Order' now,anger
Afraid confused without a road map,fear
Of course when faced with the unknown many of us would turn around and run back,fear
Something just beyond the pain of going on alone and just beyond the bravery and courage it takes to let someone in or let them fade away,sadness
Or to give someone a second chance,surprise
I don't even know for sure that it will happen but with the way things have been going I expect it to happen,surprise
There's nothing else I can say or do to change the situation,fear
Woot I finally got an ipod with video (30g)!,joy
Its kinda bad because I was feeling really sad/unhappy the day I baught it,sadness

three very dear friends of mine have lost very important people in their lives and I have had to be the strong one they can lean on,sadness
I am usually the one reduced to laying on the big green couch in the fetal position eating leftover pizza and crying about nothing and everything all at once,sadness
turns out it has just made me question pretty much everything that I thought I knew,joy

However it seems the decisions I have been making are hindering that,sadness
Un-happy people,anger
People everday get divorces commit adultery and I don't want that,sadness
I don't want to get hurt,anger
*sighs* I have a bad habit of hurting people before they can hurt me Like if I think that someone could and might hurt me then I hurt them first,anger
Then I think if I commit myself to this person only what if I'm missing out on someone else?,sadness
What if this isn't the right person for me and I'm making a huge mistake?,sadness
Why is everything so confusing to me? I'm trying to hear God right now but maybe I'm not really listening,joy

I am once again becoming an OT whore which was originally to buy myself a new gun (Springfiled XD40 3 Subcompact),anger
But with pay days in Oct being where they are and bills due on the dates they're due that idea is totally shot for now,anger
The OT whoring now is to make enough to pay bills on time not to buy new and fun things,joy
Nothing big to report except that every time I volunteer to do a full 8 hours of OT after my normal shift I find myself going home 2-4 hours into it due to them over-hiring and not realizing it,joy
We just celebrated 3 great months on the 8th and last night we carved pumpkins (she brought me a pumpkin it was pretty sweet),joy
I joined a gun club the other night,anger
Membership is only $50/year and a $50 initiation fee,anger
The shooting is unlimited for the most part between 8a and 10p,anger
This is good for the odd hour shooter like me Also there is a 25 yd outdoor range which accepts a variety of loads (shotgun magnum etc),joy
The best part is I shoot pretty well there and the lighting is really good,joy
If anyone is interested it's the Phillipsburg Pistol Club and can be found on the web (just google it's name),joy

Disaster,anger
And I still rule this town I'm just a little more mature a little more with it,fear
I met this 'straight' boy at the gay bar last night,disgust
I suppose there was the time that Dread named not for the feeling one gets when thinking about the smell which followed him but rather for his haircut came by while my mother was there and pulled bacon out of his pocket and then his other pocket and then from under his shirt then from his pants,joy
I don't know I'm not feeling it,joy
Anybody remember any good crackhouse stories they heard?,joy
The lady at the post office is starting to laugh at me Where am I going to put them all?,joy

It was called Ugly Old Hen,disgust

I emailed the seller and told him about it and he was very arrogant and rude,anger
To make a long story short he told me I must have wanted this ugly old hen to match my personality,disgust
I told him he was a f----ing a--hole and gave him a negative rating,sadness
He in turn gave me a negative rating,sadness
It really was his fault though,sadness
And because I am such a perfectionist the negative rating had me bummed for awhile but now I am better,sadness

But my beloved GP who usually just prescribes stuff for me over the phone starts throwing around words like orthopedicsurgeryand x-rays and I start thinking oh shit!,anger
Of course once he says the magic words (degenerative arthritis and not uncommon AT MY AGE) I do a total brain freeze and hear pretty much nothing afterwards,anger
So what's a girl to do to cheer herself up?,joy
Shoe shopping of course!,joy
My gene pool used to lie before me like a pretty lake and I rarely gave it much thought,anger
I'm not going to grow old gracefully!,joy
the times I have felt most free most alive ,joy
the times we have been at our best have shone brightest ,joy

I frankly would be just as happy alone,joy
Still there is so much more to learn and my life is but young,joy
lol lets just hope I don't run out of time to complete it,joy
anyway I heard this while I was in church and it really grabbed my interest,joy
I guess I fit the group the article refers to in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the support mechanism category if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well,surprise
One of those 3 will be moving this fall and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow,sadness
On a larger scale this really makes me think about the way that I've cultivated my friendships and the way I've maintained them as well,surprise
I've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I'd like to be by some of my friends and likewise there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever,joy
Suffice to say that there are a fair amount of people out there whom I would count among my friends but limited few whom I would count as good friends due to actions both inside and outside of my role in that friendship,joy
We're getting older we have a lot more work-related matters and our personal lives can get pretty complicated,joy
All in all I'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details but that's what keeps you going isn't it?,anger
I hope not,joy
As far as support mechanisms go I've seen what they do to people- at their best they act as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach,joy
Home may be where you hang your hat but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you'd even expect to look for it,joy
I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other (some of the time at least,joy
It goes back to that whole journey vs destination idea in that some people only mark success by arriving at a goal while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach that goal as well,joy
Friendship works the same way- some people only appreciate friendships which are productive and goal-oriented whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after,joy
It can be really difficult to appreciate just what a friendship really means to you especially when it's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you aren't careful,joy
I know I'm guilty of that all the time,anger
Often we fail to realize what we've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain,sadness
It sucks and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so,anger
It means I have some tough choices to make,sadness
I can only change my own mind so whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way,fear
Is it worth it or is it better to just let fate play out its' hand and look for a new deal?,joy
There's usually no way to know until it's too late regardless,sadness
I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have if it's not enough then it likely never was and in that case at least I know I tried,surprise
If being a friend isn't about trying then I've been taking the wrong approach all along,joy
As of late it seems that everything my parents do they do it just to annoy me They're great parents,anger
I love them,joy
GOD are they annoying me,anger
I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering why the hell everything turns out this way,anger
No matter how much I love them I want to be independent and living on my own providing for myself and on the road to success,joy
Now I know that I will reach this place soon enough but damn it feels like it is taking forever,anger
Lots of angry costomers with half finished work a boss who pays for the furniture but has no idea how to run a business,anger
Oh yeah and the best part:,joy
My gun my nozzles my power supply my footpedal,anger
I have been TRYING to post for three days but bloody Spaces was having issues (errors on pages) and I couldn't do it - my Wanker Boss post was due to be posted on Thursday!!,anger
Further to that by the way I did speak to him about it further when he said My new food is making me feel really healthy - yes considering he'd eated two meals of it and then gone out to dinner and Friday was going out to lunch with a friend,joy
He's paying $250 a week to eat food and then eat again,joy
Let me see - golf sitting on a beach drinking coffee bitching about money being a complete elitest snob,joy
I think though what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy I don't have to do anything option,joy
If I could afford the food I would probably do it myself but Jenny Craig was expensive enough and that was $100 a week not $250 and I didn't have a mortgage then,joy
But since he has chosen this option it's just really irritating me because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy,sadness
He could EASILY cook his own food - his kitchen probably cost more than half my house,joy
Sorry for the ranting post but I'm just really annoyed that here I am struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss and someone like this with no concept of struggle can just pay someone to lose it for him,sadness
YOU LIKE ALMOST HIT ME OMG she said tossing her dyed blonde hair like an enraged horse nostrils flaring,anger
I'm not very nice not when facing death,anger
OMFG if there is like damage,anger
I must admit I was kind of fascinated by the way her eyes rimmed in black eyeliner managed to stay so wide open like that,joy
It went on like that for a good minute,joy
Finally I got fed up,joy
THis was when the Princess turned into some sort of psychobitch from hell,anger
I guess someone forgot her midol,surprise
I got mad,anger
Now when one says you hit like a girl take it as a compliment,anger
I hit that bitch so hard,anger
must have been a dye job gone HELLA bad,anger
And I found out in the most annoying way,anger
I walked over to the heater as the first port of call and was very surprised when 'oh!' it wouldn't turn on,surprise
Now I thought at first that maybe it had broken the night before after I'd gone to bed or something,anger
Trying to turn it back on only got me another automatic trip as lights flashed on for a brief moment and then suddenly back off,surprise
At first one of my housemates thought about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues,sadness
In then end my other housemate's lovely girlfriend (love you heaps babes!),joy
So we've now gone over 48 hours without a fridge (hate to think what half our food is like in there!),anger
In other news I have 6 days to go (including today) before I leave!,surprise
As we wrote in a recent posting even in a favorable political climate Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters,anger
Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance we detect no real signs so far (at least in Harris County) of a groundswell to actually vote in November,anger
An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks however has been that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th,fear
The argument goes that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs a protracted expensive war with no conclusion in sight and a perception among religious conservatives that George W Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters,anger
As noted in the latest issue of US News amp; World Report new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall with confidence that they will vote to return their party's elected officials to power,joy
The article cites a recent strategic memo to national GOP Party Chair Ken Mehlman from Market Strategies which highlights polling (granted six-week old polling) showing the base is in line and ready to hit the polls,anger
Is this spin or is it true?,joy
Obviously no way to tell at this point but any Democratic victory strategy that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly,joy
In other words the mantra for Democratic candidates this political season: persuade everyone you can turn out your base and assume all the other guy's usual folks will vote,anger
In other words Democrats work like hell until November 7th,anger
with a smile ofcourse,joy
and we're both being the best we can for each other and it shows and it pays off,joy
we have come such a far way in such a short time and I look forward to every other moment I will share with him,joy
I am his all his already I know this and I hope he does too,joy
I duno im kinda losing track of wht I want to say here,anger
I will cherish him ad love him and let him know im there and I care for him everyday that we have together,joy
stephen was a little abusive mainly with words and feelings directed at me / to make me feel bad,anger
chris had a problem with words too and his anger,anger
other than that hed get offended or pissed off or ignorant about it,anger
gudam why did I waste so much time on his sorry ass?,disgust
After church I went to one of my best friend's house for lunch,joy
My mother was invited too,joy
I saw the guy I went to a dance with once back at school there at her house,joy
It's her brother's best friend,joy
Hm was a bit weird,disgust
We had a good lunch with Gino Genelli ice-cream!,joy
(However you spell the Genelli part) Ah we talked about Anri's ex and her mom mentioned how Anri was angry with her dad the one time the ex visited cos her dad kept him busy most of the day,anger
Anyhow her dad asked her then at the table but why would you be angry with your dad,anger
Whahahaha I nearly cracked myself and don't think I didn't blush,anger
Then Anri wanted to go the beach cos she just visited for the weekend and has to go back to where she studies in another suburb like hunderds of km's away from the ocean,joy
We went in my car cos apparently I have music,joy
We sat on the beach and mostly I felt like sleeping,joy
Now that was fun,joy
Just guys flying their kites,fear
=/ And some guy on a prepelled engine driven kite thing that was in the air,disgust
LOVE IT!,joy
It is like doing my art,joy
I get lost in it,sadness
Coffeee and dark chocolate!,joy
Lizelle wanted to go to the movies and I wanted to go to church and Anri I don't know what,joy
Lizelle didn't want to go to church,joy
Really sad how we can actually sit and wonder in your one hand is God and the other hand is a movie,joy
(Non-christians don't worry about this part I am just expressing my thoughts doesn't mean I don't accept you still as a person just kinda thinking out loud to people that believe the same as me) Hmmm,sadness
I sat there drawing and uhm the phone rang and it was the police,fear
If you were given the choice between life and death which one would you choose?,anger
The choice does seem quite obvious to me But what if you knew you were gonna die like possibly sooner than later for whatever reason,sadness
I have a friend that is gonna die probably sooner than later and I was angry because some of the choices he has made in the last few years have cut his time down to virtually nothing,anger
Imagine you are young and healthy,joy
The whole world and it's endless possibilities are stretched out before you,anger
You have wonderful friends that love and cherish you,joy
Then things start to take a turn in an unexpected direction,joy
Think constant arguing lies and deception money mismanagement and infidelity,anger
So you decide to join the military,fear
You figure 'Hey I might as well use this opportunity to see the world make some money and get an education and a marketable skill',anger
The recruiter tells you that the technology field in which you are interested is growing rapidly and there are all types of jobs available that you can parlay into a lucrative career once you retire from the service,sadness
You leave there with a renewed sense of purpose and vow to take full advantage of this experience,surprise
The recruiter comes in the office with a look of sadness and disappointment,sadness
You think to yourself that maybe you had too many traffic tickets or maybe there was something small in your past that has presented you from being selected to join the military,fear
You begin to prepare yourself to hear bad news and immediately go into self preservation mode to plan out your next move,anger
) but we won't be able to welcome you into the Armed Forces(or I could do some traveling and explore the country,anger
We have the results from your physical(I know I'm gonna do some volunteer work with kids in the community,joy
But he assured me that he had used a condom and that I was the only one that he was having unprotected sex with,joy
So imagine my surprise when I was about to engage in activities with him and saw an of color coming from you know where,joy
She then tells me that she's gonna test me for gonorrhea but also that she's gonna have to test me for HIV,anger
She tells me that if I was with a person that was infected with gonorrhea what makes me think that person didn't have anything else?,anger
Fortunately my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and HIV,sadness
I was of course thankful but I realized something very important during that time,joy
The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking,anger
He never went to see an infectious disease specialist,sadness
He partied just as hard as I did drank and smoked just as much weed as me So after I learned of his condition I thought to myself Is my friend trying to die?,joy
When we first became friends he was an athelete so he was pretty fit for the most part,joy
I had never known to do much of anything unhealthy and he was one of those health conscious work out fanatics,sadness
Maybe he maintained that lifestyle in the beginning because he thought that he could somehow combat his illness this way,fear
Could it be that he realized that no matter what he did there was nothing that would get rid of his disease so he lived and played hard and masked his pain with lots of partying drugs and lots of random annonymous sex?,sadness
But I think about it alot and I wonder exactly when did he decide to die?,sadness
I wonder what choices I would have made differently had that nurse from the clinic given me different results,surprise
Would you choose to live or would you choose to die?,sadness
However if you are so compelled to do so please leave your thoughts and comments,surprise
my birthday is on monday,joy
I miss myrtle beach,joy
its not bad here at all,anger
good b/c I def dont have the money to move out right now,joy
bad b/c I want to move out mother eff,sadness
maybe things wont be so bad,anger
im feeling you,joy
Well I'm surprised that I actually found it,surprise
so I searched for it and finally found it,joy
I've been thinking a great deal about the importance of ritual,joy
Not religious ritual (like baptism) or societal ritual (like shaking hands) but personal ritual,fear
Like that bag in American Beauty,joy
One of my most surprising observations about this whole ritual thing is how much easier it was to establish new rituals when I was on location as opposed to being at home,anger
And the corollary: how easy it is to slip into old habits once back at home,surprise
but when I started thinking about things I do regularly that I enjoy that's definitely one of them,joy
A time to relax be pampered catch up,surprise
* A ritual I absolutely adore is going to the outdoor screenings at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery during the summer,joy
There are all sorts of mini-rituals that go into this regular event including the collection of picnic dinner items and the precision methodology by which one gets the perfect spot on the lawn,joy
* When I'm NOT working I have been known to take myself to brunch on the weekends: just me and whatever novel I'm currently enjoying,joy
Maybe after this show ends I'll be able to start a new garden,anger
This is not good,joy
* I'm happy to taste any new flavor of ice cream (I love to try new flavors!) but when it comes to ordering it's always Mint Chip,joy
* My fear of insomnia keeps me from going to bed when I'm really tired,anger
The image of cartoonist after cartoonist sitting at folding tables selling comic books is truly a pathetic one,sadness
Don't sweat it that's just my perception: I traveled the hour and a half trip down on Saturday with American Hero Chris Mautner (he attained that storied status by agreeing to drive) arrived a half-hour after the doors opened stayed until 5:30 then went right back home,surprise
My SPX in other words was full of shopping and stalking the aisles,anger
I met an awful lot of fine creators but I hated taking up much of their table time; heaven knows by the afternoon there's a swarm of people waiting to trudge through the byways between tables and one thousand distractions to attend to,disgust
I'd never been to a comics show in my life so I'd not known any SPX other than what was presented to me there: a pretty swank hotel a table to pay at in the hall outside and big ballroom with everyone selling everything inside and a bunch of other rooms to have educational and informative events in though all of those were down the hall around the bend and down an escalator,joy
To say there was no color at all would be misleading since it was a nice day and there were a number of trees and things but I did not detect any local pulse at all,anger
I went out for lunch with Chris and Gina Gagliano of First Second; food became curiously hard to find within hiking distance (in the interests of full disclosure my mastery of direction also had us walking the wrong way for a good while),joy
After we passed by a large parking lot promising a furniture blowout sale as well as a haunted attraction and possibly ponies or something in the back we decided to turn around and stop at a little diner we'd passed on the way,sadness
We hurried back from the gray highway to the center of comics and people followed close behind by haunted ponies who'd just bought cheap Barcaloungers for their ghost stable and were now jonesing for independent comics,sadness
I love walking around for things to buy and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won't raise too many personal hackles let me tell you,joy
I'm also really glad I had Chris with me since he knew a lot of faces that I didn't; he made a fine guide though one of us would occasionally wander away from the other in the vein of the old NES version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? though I'm unsure as to which one of us was Bob Hoskins,joy
Actually I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency (I heard it was a bit different in prior years with multiple selling rooms and all); if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness,joy
A diverse audience too everything from young to old from old-school nerds to stylish-looking folk from aged hippies to teenage Goths,joy
There was nowhere to sit in the former since I got there late so I sort of drifted in and out of hearing distance,sadness
Someone behind me turned to someone else and whispered It's just like Civil War,fear
The Chippendale talk was different a highly entertaining digression-prone ramble by the artist through his history and procedure moderated by Dan Nadel and with extra bonus contributions from Brian Ralph who was seated in the back of the room,joy
Nobody was particularly brusque at SPX at least from among the artists but I found Chippendale to be consistently the most emphatic and friendly creator around,joy
And I bought a good deal of stuff too,joy
I tried to follow Tom's rule of not buying anything on my first trip around the room but that didn't quite hold,surprise
I managed to get through the whole show without finding anything I really wanted sold out however and I only had to stand in the Line of Shame at the ATM once,sadness
Awakening Comics 1-2 by Steve Peters amp; friends (I reviewed his The Origin of Sparky a few weeks ago; having walked away from the table and indeed the entire convention I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to actually tell Steve Peters who I was - another triumph of intellect!),surprise
Cinema Sewer 19 edited by Robin Bougie (new issue of the funny comics-heavy pamphlet-format magazine devoted entirely to the finest in exploitation and pornographic film - a creator's personality-powered publication and I assure you that Robin Bougie is in real life exactly the way he portrays himself in the mag),disgust
Cold Heat 1-2 (of 12) by Ben Jones amp; Frank Santoro (2 debuted at the show; the odd semi-abstract fantasy/action book that Diamond initially disliked a while back complaining of its format despite the fact that it's 100% a serialized pamphlet-format comic),anger
Ed the Happy Clown 2 (of 9) by Chester Brown (the one I was missing - who says you can't score back-issues at these things?!),joy
Fuzz amp; Pluck in Splitsville 4 (of 5) by Ted Stearn (surely I can't be the only fan of the mighty Fuzz amp; Pluck; still I've never seen this in a store though Fantagraphics had it at their table),anger
Paping 11 by various (older issue of a deluxe anthology by some interesting-looking creators; the real showpiece was issue 14 with its solid wood covers and impressive prints 'n comics mishmash interior the whole thing bound by red shoelaces; I just didn't have the roughly $30 needed to spend on it by that point in the show though),sadness
Project: Romantic by various (debuted at the show the newest in AdHouse's Project series of anthologies this one strictly devoted to romance comics),joy
PulphopeA by Paul Pope (a show exclusive I think; not the full Pope art book coming soon from AdHouse but a 200 copy ashcan with some exclusive stuff),joy
So it was a nice trip,surprise
A lot of good things to have and good hands to shake,joy
I hope to do it again and add on a few more convention experience points,joy
My Mother Is A Fish,joy
Some of my girlfriends have found it a little strange; I think it's one of the reasons they break up with me in the end as if they need anymore reasons,joy
To try and remedy this I spend my nights reading,joy
But it was a good read and if I did have a dream where I had sex with my mother well now I'd know what it means,joy
I guess it's hard to read about a condition when you don't know the name of it,surprise
I didn't always have this problem,sadness
Actually I don't remember much about my childhood,joy
All this not sleeping has a terrible way of playing with your memory,anger
It's Sunday but tomorrow might be a holiday,joy
But I think I work on that holiday,joy
I weigh about 180 lbs I'm about 5' 10 I don't have anything that seems to be wrong with me I have these weird scars on my neck,disgust
An accident,surprise
And there's the scar on my lip,anger
I would say it was from some drunken night of excess but I've never blacked out either,disgust
I remember every second every horrific moment leaning over a toilet and puking,disgust
It's unfair that I can remember things like that so well yet I can't even tell you much about what happened in the rest of my life,anger
You'd think that'd be a problem at work but it's menial stuff,sadness
I spend most of my time in my cube typing and filing thinking about what I read the night before trying to process it trying to figure out what is/has been happening to me Last night I read As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner,anger
It's kind of confusing,joy
I'll have to look when I get home,anger
I guess it's getting colder and it's getting to be time for dinner or far enough after work or whatever,surprise
I suppose the cold should annoy me But it doesn't I begin to take off my shoes,anger
People tell me that the water in the lakes around here isn't that good,joy
But people swim in this right?,joy
The water can't be that bad,anger
Something my mother sang to me to put me to sleep,joy
I don't listen to music but I know this song,joy
I quickly strip,sadness
My neck tingles as I hit the water and I sink blowing bubbles,anger
They slowly stop coming out of my mouth but my neck continues to tingle,surprise
Like Alice in Wonderland on a bad acid trip fucked up,anger
Mind you I've been treated like the asshole of the house for the past couple of weeks and I didn't even do anything at all to deserve it,anger
But it's all good when folks need or want something isn't it?,joy
And then one of them played a song that made me think of my mom and suddenly I'm so depressed that all I want to do is go curl up in a ball and die,sadness
But for now I go hide,fear
It's nice kind of being able to put everything together in my head,joy
I'm sure by now most people heard about the really sad disappearance and murder of Michelle-Gardner Quinn a UVM student,anger
It's pretty awful- there's not much else to say about it,anger
I found out about it on the way to Boston this weekend and I was just shocked,joy
I transferred from a school in an unsafe part of a city to UVM and found it to be much more laid back and free,joy
Even just this last week there is a definite change in atmosphere around these parts that is pretty sad,joy
I really can't imagine what her family and friends are going through right now because it's a really unnecessary situation- she did not have to die and that's probably the saddest part,sadness
It was so fun seeing everyone from way back- we ran into Eric and went out to see Michele so it was just so fun,joy
Work and school are getting a little intense but I've found that I can do it- I just need to stay focused,joy
and I am excited about the little booger haha,joy
Okay off to clean this room,joy
My mom would be so proud of me,joy
cold rainy day,sadness
no easy transition into this weather; it felt more like winter than fall up on the trail,sadness
I didn't see her on Wednesday so I was surprised to find her at the shelter this morning,surprise
once we got a the top of the trail and started to head down some spastic switch got turned on because she started acting a jumpy darting all over the place picking up stones randomly chewing on tree roots etc she probably wanted to play but there's not much room for that on the trail especially on the way down a steep trail,surprise
I was surprised to see her sitting so still; spastic switch must have been turned off,surprise
he was a stray found wandering Discovery Park,joy
he has a bad left eye which I don't think he has any vision,anger
during the run we were calling him Lance (since he was nameless) because when he was laying on his back in the grass he would kick his legs like he was riding a bike; I wrote this stuff down on his sheet but I guess the officer's didn't like the name,anger
Finally a picture update!,joy
Justin's Birthday:,joy
and here is the birthday boy,joy
this boy jumped in and blew it!,disgust
This smile made me more scared,joy
I adore her with all my heart,joy
His dad didn't mind us taking pictures but I think this boy did,disgust
XD Oh well~ He was one coolio child,joy
This event was sooo fun!,joy
It was like an exciting adventure where we walked 6 miles in the cold!,joy
we were freezing to death,anger
SO this is where we begin our journey,joy
Eff questions how the belt keeps up his pants,anger
Someone unexpected from your past with resurface,joy
[and guess what!,surprise
Then another someone unexpected too],joy
Mr Fortune Cookie you are the bomb-diggity,joy
As for Eff he got You will find the road to happiness by helping others,joy
It was pretty good,joy
Our first conversation was an argument in English class,anger
XD Yes people he was baring a child and then someone popped it,joy
Anywho~ Today was fun,joy
I am going to do the AIDS walk again next year for fun,joy
That's all for now I have homework,fear
watching Mother Nature's lightshow I see,joy
enormous mounds of gray cotton batting clouds only momentarily visible as they are back-lit by silent random flashbulbs,sadness
I stretch my arms out as far as they will reach just as the first drum rolls of thunder pound my ears,anger
Being the tallest object on the beach in a thunderstorm and living to write about it,joy
Regardless of my temporal status as far as my brother is concerned time still moves ahead at a frighteningly rapid pace,surprise
No not the new first season the William Hartnell black and white forty years ago suck it I'm the first Doctor first season,joy
Once I have them all then I think I'll start on Blackadder,anger
I spent the majority of the day up in Madison (hi Robby I would have waved but I'm not sure where your house is),joy
Their historical society was having a century home tour as a fund raiser and my mother wanted to go,joy
I assumed that with my niece in New York and my sister working a weekend job to keep her there that it would just be my mother and I; little did I know that she invited my sister-in-law to accompany us,joy
On the plus side the home tour put me in the holiday spirit,joy
This week I am totally going to start my Christmas shopping,joy
I used to have it all done by Halloween so maybe I'll return to that tradition,anger
It's not so much a matter of the early bird getting the worm as it is the procrastinating bird getting splattered by the semi out on I-90,surprise
And on that note enjoy the remainder of your Sunday,joy
Well we're half-way through our trip,surprise
There is a church or ruins everywhere you look,joy
That it is still standing for us to see is well I feel very lucky,joy
The lines around the wall was insanely long,fear
We walked around pretty much the entire city until we found it,joy
It was beautiful and FULL of people and tour buses,joy
Again we stood in line to enter the church,joy
It's pretty cool,joy
So anyway Rome in general was loud dirty and absolutely chock-full of people and cars and bikes,disgust
The city really is like a human being especially in the morning as you watch and hear it begin to awaken,fear
I've been trying not to think about my life back home but sometimes it sneaks in uninvited,sadness
What the hell am I going to do when I get back home?,anger
These questions completely depress me,sadness
I can dream and earthquake and it'll actually happen!!!,anger
that's not entirely true,joy
what really happened was that an earthquake started and instead of waking up first I incorporated it into a dream where I was watching a documentary about earthquakes and they were recounting some classic earthquake showing how it would pulse stronger and stronger,anger
I was very attentive and it didn't seem like she was gonna break so I just stayed there and eventually it stopped and I passed out again,surprise
eitherw ay finally got up for a while after talkin' to him and my sis and mom listened to the radio for a little while (on my MP3 player 'cause the power was knocked out) and it was all fine,joy
so I went back to sleep 'till noon took beau for a walk surfed for four hours cooked in the dark read by candlelight for a little while adn then the power came back on so I could watch tv,sadness
all my plans were shot to shit 'cause the cell waves were all packed and I couldn't get in touch with my friends very well,anger
and there was a storm at the same time so that didn't help,anger
then I needed a drink and naturally don't have beer and I expected all the beer at the supermarket to be warm,joy
oh earthquake was rated highest at a 66,surprise
what surprised me most (geekin' it up) was the frequency of the rumbles,surprise
an avalanche (movie sounds) or rock slide,surprise
the amount of energy required to move that much mass SUSTAINED at such a high frequency is ridiculous,anger
She said that Kubik would be hanging out and I could come if I wanted,anger
I jump shrieking a little before I realize it's only Kubik,joy
Original plan was to watch Brokeback Mountain but I saw that 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate is on and ask if we can watch that,fear
The two of them watch it I half watch the movie while reading the newspaper sometimes out loud but Kubik complains SOMEONE IS TALKING while I'm trying to watch a movie!! but Karina defends me You're one to talk,fear
We watch Project Runway but the repetition of the same 5 commercials becomes old fast,fear
Around 1 pm Karina tells us that we need to leave because it's late,sadness
As I'm walking to the metro station a teenage boy in his mixed group of 4 or 5 friends hanging outside yells I like your haircut! and I answer Thankswhile I keep walking having seen Erica and Diana enter a little bit earlier,disgust
A compliment from a trendy teenager can brighten up anyone's day,joy
The three of us find our way to the Spy Museum and I'm surprised by the number of young couples who are there in addition to the usual elderly tourists and young families,surprise
I'm the slowest to go through the exhibits and I soon lose Erica and Diana occasionally catching up with them when they slow down,anger
The fake vent opens to another part of the exhibit and I get out,anger
We stop in the gift shop before heading home,joy
The wind blows strongly outside and Diana has a hard time pushing open the door but a 7 or 8 year old boy who's already exited with his family helps her out by pulling while she pushes,disgust
I woke up early and checked on my little Chirp,joy
She is looking better than she did but hasn't eaten anything so I hope she continues to heal,joy
I had to fly out the door this morning and ended up being 10 minutes late for class but we were doing a group project so I dived in and did my part,sadness
I think he knows not to cross the line he crossed once before,anger
I do love the Chun Li pictures I found,joy
She's always been one of my favorite video game characters,joy
maybe it's because she can beat the living shit out of guys heh,anger
I love her outfit as well except I think the laughing after she wins a fight in street fighter is kind of silly but that's just me Kikyo from the Inuyasha series has been another favorite of mine,joy
have a true normal life,joy
EICON1 love u hun,joy
The remake and the character Deunan Knute just engaged me big time so I had to include some pictures,joy
Went home and finished the luncheon posters than I had to leave early for my eye appointment,surprise
medical and dental but I definetly need my loan to secure all my funds,fear
I than went to Office Max and got two jump drives,joy
They were on a special and heh,joy
I think the cashier made a mistake but I didn't say anything,sadness
I believe she entered in $1788 instead of $1888 so I got an unexpected discount,joy
It's a SanDisk Micro 10 GB jump drive so not a bad deal,joy
I guess for me theres just no hope,surprise
As I have said before I am happily not taking a class this semester but these two particular functions were ones that were not to be missed,joy
The first was the dedication of a painting that was donated to the school by the students of fear Damien Dietlein OSB the Old Testament Professor there,anger
The entire enterprise was done as a surprise to Damo (our name for Father) and he was genuinely touched and surprised by the affair,surprise
The evening's speaker happened to be another of my professors: fear,anger
Denis Robinson OSB whom I had for Early Church History and had been telling mrangelmeg about for months,joy
His topic was John Henry Newman and Catholic Education,disgust
I really wanted mrangelmeg to have a chance to experience fear,anger
Denis because he is a force with which to be reckoned,anger
After that discussion we spent some time in the little bar on campus which is called the Unstable ( Benedictines take a vow of stability so they call the bar the Unstable get it?),surprise
We had a wonderful time,joy
I have to admit knowing that those of my friends who were there for fear,anger
Denis' class on Creed were having a quiz on Heresies in the early church on Saturday morning I was more than happy to be returning home Friday night,joy
something the Internet has been missing since it was born!,sadness
Try out this first primer a quick five minute guide to learning and loving classical music,joy
Five minutes is all you need so grab a glass of your favorite wine and enjoy your newfound knowledge!,joy
If these prissy little installments are truly helpful I may just have to take more requests!,joy
Classical Music 101,joy
Welcome to the world of classical music,joy
It's my world a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure,joy
It's the oldest recognized type of music in Western civilization and it dates back well into the Middle Ages,joy
Since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence let's study this music from one era to the next,joy
Most music historians identify anywhere from four to seven distinct eras in classical music and since I recognize all seven let's learn about each one:,joy
Middle Ages (450 AD to 1450 AD): Shortly after the fall of the Roman Empire the first era of classical music was born,sadness
Our first composers were mostly supported by the church (surprise!) and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source,joy
There was no formal system of notation making composing very difficult and time-consuming,fear
Renaissance (1450 - 1600): Humans discovered that Earth is not the center of the universe so classical music changed along with the rest of the arts,joy
Music became more of an expressive art than a science and music was now being printed allowing sacred secular and instrumental music to spread everywhere,joy
Governments now influenced the spread of the era's music more than the church,joy
Composers developed the idea of the sonata the concerto and the symphony where great performers (called virtuosos) found enormous success,joy
Composers used counterpoint dance rhythms and repetition in their music,joy
Think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow,joy
Anyway classical music wasn't even called classical music back in this time,joy
Romantic (1825-1900): Lush and beautiful music was the prevailing theme during most of the 1800s and music was written to tell stories to depict the mysteries of nature or to express the upper reaches of human emotions,joy
Composers of this era such as Tchaikovsky Brahms and Chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range using a larger variety of instruments,surprise
20th Century: 1900-1999: Classical music exploded evolved and splintered faster than it ever had before,joy
New subcategories of classical music were born every year and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined,joy
Music of this era was influenced by anything and everything including world wars politics SEX and cross-pollination by other types of music such as jazz,joy
Finally music could be recorded and distributed widely creating a burgeoning market for all types of new music,joy
Over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period including Copland Stravinsky and Ravel,sadness
Needless to say neither the church nor the government contributed much to classical music in this century,joy
Contemporary Classical: 1970 - 2050 (projected): If the 20th Century period ends in 1999 then what do we call all classical music written thereafter?,joy
Welcome to the contemporary classical period where we see even more subcategories such as the minimalism of Philip Glass the electric opera by John Corigliano and the twelve-tone works of John Bilotta a Bay Area composer!,joy
The few creative barriers that may have been left after the 20th century have been crushed by a whopping 300 000 living composers and this contemporary period gives new meaning to the phrase Anything Goes!,anger
There is so much more to learn but this is your first step into removing the mystery from these vast eras,surprise
Your next few leaps into classical music should now be a little easier!,joy
Add a little passion to your life each time you visit and share my world with me!,joy
Measure 40 amends the state constitution to require supreme court and appeals judges to be elected by district instead of the statewide vote that currently happens,anger
Arguments in favor: 29,anger
Arguments in opposition: 20,anger
8 of the pro arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges,anger
Both sides have a mixture of more polemic arguments and more reasonable arguments,anger
There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political whether those positions already are political whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas (think every rural area) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts etc,surprise
All in all most of the arguments are not very convincing one way or the other,anger
One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton,anger
This surprised me because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other,surprise
As such I consider him to be primarily a politician and it is rare that I find what I might consider words of wisdom from a politician even when I agree with them,anger
The one other somewhat-convincing argument was immediately after that one also in favor by an organization of Oregon farmers,anger
There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument something not really present anywhere else,anger
my words tend to come out always as a substandard to how they sound on the workfloor of the psyche,anger
finding this out is almost as fun as finding out the effects of placing one's hand down a working garbage disposal unit,joy
lately all im capable is questioning things and my ablility to deal,joy
I don't want to make a mistake that I can't undo,sadness
I don't want to burn any bridges incase I've crossed the wrong one,anger
my paranoia really knows no bounds,fear
found out my mother cut open the top of her left foot and got 11 stitches good job mommy :D!,joy
I talked to her today she's ok still a mess since I left from what my dad's told me but nothing new there,disgust
mormor is is dealing w/ senile dementia still,sadness
it makes me sad she's a tough old bird but she's just 'not home anymore',sadness
I like/can deal w/ most of my classes,joy
to nap,joy
prof is killing me with what she assigns though,anger
lost a syillibis for US Gov but the class is so cut 'n' dry that it's no worry,sadness
you know the one where it has a shocked expression w/ pumpkin guts coming out of its mouth,surprise
and handling of pumpkin guts which is double fun esp when you have a squimish person working w/ you XD,joy
but im still laughing a lot,joy
things make me laugh here esp my roommates,joy
and u can only guess who was in it,surprise
but I'll give ya a clue,anger
BLUE EYES!,sadness
surprising I know,surprise
dont worry its not,sadness
nothing else happened in the dream we just cuddled and it was real sweet,joy
like wanting to dooo any thing to be with him!,sadness
ok peace,joy
Seeing a scarred bearded man in a rippling black overcoat warmed my heart because his fingers were painting a trembling solo on his acoustic guitar,sadness
I sat down beside him and ran lines in my head for a while while a few feet away the song poured from his strings,fear
Eventually the music faded away and the guitar slipped back into its bag,joy
Yeah sure I'll watch your guitar,fear
I was very disappointed,anger
but I insisted on getting a violin so I took the bus to spirited music and rented one from there,joy
I think I'm quite good for the amount of time I've been playing,joy
besides the usual mary had a little lamb and junk I can play swing low sweet chariot silent night chopin's funeral march and I taught myself hurt by nine inch nails/johnny cash by ear because I couldn't find any proper sheet music for it,joy
its actually a pretty easy song I suggest it for all beginers who are really quite sick of playing twinkle twinkle,joy
those pegs are hard to push back in especially the E string peg that was a real bitch,anger
he said if I practise a lot and get really good to let him know because his band is looking for a violinist,joy
that would be pretty sweet,joy
last night me and mike and christina and a bunch of people went to the bar and I got raving drunk on just 2 coolers,anger
I suck when im drunk I just get dizzy and fall asleep so once I was finished making an idiot of myself at the bar I dozed for hours on mikes couch,sadness
and disgusting!,anger
I love the show because I learn so much,joy
Many times I'll hear commentators and sometimes I'll even agree with them,anger
Markets do not measure everything accurately and I find this assumption to be disgusting,anger
And the Walmartisation of the world changes markets for the worse for labour making people a mere slot in a computerised schedule with no regard for their free time,sadness
Forcing the world into markets is exactly what creates so many problems in the world (*ahem* people are at war with us over it you know),fear
It is dangerous to force everything into a market mentality,fear
It makes everything homogeneous in texture sure but you never are able to enjoy it in its own context,joy
Let's not promote gambling the security and livelihoods of people just because they're a few thousand miles away or brown,surprise
How disgusting would it be to see 9/11 turn into a 'market'?,anger
And who would be the bastard who profits off of the destruction of my workplace and life?,anger
Their bets on the probability of this one terrorist action would be reflected in the price of the contract,anger
Plus in such a secretive government wouldn't this promote corruption?,fear
The selling of top secret documents to profit off of the killing of 150 people in a mosque?,anger
There's no reason to encourage them (ok us),joy
And there's really no reason to encourage those who can afford to gamble on this sort of thing to do something so dispicable and amoral,joy
It is sickening,anger
There is so much room for the worst of humanity in doing things like this let's not encourage it please!,joy
In the last three years terrorism has flourished,anger
I shudder to think,fear
Here's another great case of Redcoat Logic,sadness
Apparently the extremist terrorists in Britain are connected to the insurgents in Iraq (despite the fact that the former were pure terrorists and the latter are involved in a civil war) and that a slow exit from Iraq was their goal,fear
Does no one see the problem with that logic?,sadness
The war in Iraq is fighting terrorists,anger
Terrorists are all one giant unit,fear
I'd also like to point out that the liberal complaint is not that we're fighting terrorists it's that we're NOT fighting terrorists,anger
The complaint is that we abandoned the search for bin Laden in Afghanistan and went into Iraq under incredibly false premises,anger
I'm worried that too many people both in politics and out don't appreciate the seriousness of the threat to American security and the evil of the enemy that faces usMr Lieberman said at the Waterbury event,anger
He called that threat more evil or as evil as Nazism and probably more dangerous than the Soviet Communists we fought during the long cold war,fear
To suggest that a couple of disorganized idiots trying to replicate Yousef's 1995 plot is more evil and more dangerous than what they did is beyond off-base beyond stupid,fear
It's flat-out disgusting,anger
Another apocalyptic vision last night: wandering through large rooms that are stuffy and crowded with people lying on the floor covered with sheets most of them separate from each other,anger
Some aggressive people with mean faces and nasty attitudes staking out their turf telling us to move along,anger
We try to find comfortable space and head down a winding staircase that seems to get smaller as it gets to the bottom,sadness
Then I am outside and they are calling the name D'Angelo for people to board rescue vehicles,joy
The bees and the body somehow melt away as the rescue vehicles begin to depart - leaving me behind,joy
I am by no means an art critic,joy
I know very little about art save the few well-known artists that everyone knows,joy
For my birthday Jon took me to the Getty Center in Los Angeles,joy
The only art I have ever been exposed to is the stuff that pretentious college drop-outs create and try to sell by hanging it on the walls for coffee shops,joy
It's easy to Google Image search Monet and look at the results but pictures and posters hold no candle to the real deal,joy
Oh and I think I made the security guards really nervous - like I was going to blow my runny nose on the Renoir and forever ruin it with my bodily fluids,fear
(Pretty no? You should see it in person!),joy
Like I said I'm no judge of art,joy
The purpose - to catch Body Worlds 2 while we could (the exhibit had already come and gone to LA so this was the only chance we would get),surprise
I was excited to see it as I have a fondness of cadavers (blame Gross Anatomy) and really wanted to get another shot at some up close anatomy viewing,joy
In Gross Anatomy our cadavers were solemn - laying on the tables as if in a deep slumber,disgust
Also interesting were the cases of organs - healthy and diseased,sadness
The odd thing about Body Worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of Cadaver Carnival of Bizarre Art,surprise
(I can't find any good images of the weird displays so to view some you have to look here at the International Body Worlds Online Store),joy
Again I am no judge of art and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that I am off-base,joy
Body Worlds is great in that it gives everyday people the chance to look at the machinery that is the body,surprise
The general public also has a chance to look at diseased organs (something usually reserved for pathologists who I've noticed seem to get *very* excited over things like polyps and necrosis),surprise
However for me the more artistic exhibits were more of a turn off - I willingly admit that I was very attached to my cadaver in Gross and the thought of him being displayed like that makes me a bit sick,disgust
Then again I'm not a good judge of art,joy
As an aside there have been some interesting articles regarding the aquisition of cadavers for exhibits such as Body Worlds (I guess the entire affair has sparked various knock-off exhibits!),surprise
Due to increased demand for bodies China has stepped into the body buisness,anger
While this country has access to huge numbers of scientists and medical students (someone has to do the dirty work) there have been some controversies and questions as to where the cadavers come from,fear
The creator of Body Worlds has denied that his specimines have been acquired in any dubious manner and has documentation to that effect,sadness
However some of the knock-offs might not be as professional (personally I'd avoid them if I were you),fear
I won't make any more comments about it and leave it in your hands,surprise
I dislike feeling ill Especially when I had plans for the weekend,disgust
which of course makes me feel nauseous,sadness
Besides all of that I've been feeling great,joy
I was able to tell all of the teachers at school that I am pregnant so it's been fun to hear all of their pregnancy stories,joy
Everyone keeps asking if we're going to find out if we're having a boy or girl,disgust
This afternoon I went shopping for school supplies,joy
Summer has gotten to me and now it needs to leave,surprise
The most exciting time of my whole summer was going to Virginia with the Patricks Pearsons and Roths and that lasted less than a week,joy
Tomorrow I hope either my mother or father takes me to go buy school clothes,joy
I don't except them to because my Dad is taking my brother golfing (as previously stated) and my mother hates the mall more than she hates anything else,joy
Scott is losing the card game from what I can hear,anger
My mother just asked Chris How would you prefer your crab?,joy
Or hot with butter and garlic?,anger
I tried making a collage of magazine cutouts (or in my case rip outs,sadness
My cat Roxie is very nervous,fear
She was just eating cat food a few feet away from me She saw my brother look at her and ran away,joy
As she was running a kernel of catfood fell from her mouth and now it's all soggy on the floor,surprise
It's pretty disgusting,anger
I freakin hate when you get in a bad mood and its not just one thing,anger
its just kinda just a bunch of little things and then you get sad and you just want to go cry and just be away from reality,sadness
I mean I know but I cant put it into words and I just dont want to say it I guess,anger
and im not trying to be mean but if I say I dislike someone and you are like why why why and I try to explain but you're just like thats stupid you shouldnt dislike her it pisses me off if I have to defend myself for disliking someone,anger
and that's one of the only people I highly dislike,anger
actually thats the only person I highly dislike,anger
I mean I have my reason to dislike someone and you shouldnt question them cuz you arent me and you dont know and just stop,anger
cuz I hate tryin to prove myself to everyone,anger
I consider myself a nice person and I should have the right to dislike some people,anger
I give everyone a fair chance I think,surprise
Then I guess my head slammed into the window behind me and I fell on the floor,surprise
It's because of thing called vasovagal syncope and was triggered because I have a kidney infection that was making me dehydrated and nauseous,sadness
I hope I can at least pass out sometime when it's sweet like when I'm driving or operating heavy machinery,joy
I did not climb very high up but was not bad either,anger
I spent my national day like I always do at home to watch the national parade,fear
My school choir was taking part and I saw them too,joy
I love the song Absolutely Everybody ever since the parade,joy
Well I'll try to write more often,anger
I guess it's a lot more involved than I had thought,surprise
After that I had pretty much decided that it was giving up time,joy
I guess that made me feel a little bit more at ease,surprise
My change was exact down to the last penny what a relief that was for me lol,fear
But it was wasn't so bad since I got to hang out with Lauren the night before :]To make this somewhat shorter,anger
My charges were50 short but apparently that's not a horrible thing,anger
HORRIBLE,anger
It's a bit more satisfying this time than most since I'm now past the second of the three major problem classes I identified when I first got back into school,sadness
I assume until proven otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1,joy
However there are several things I know full well I've been between mediocre and bad at in the past- theoretical math foreign languages public speaking,anger
So far that's turned out to be little problem- I believe I got perhaps 4 questions wrong over 5 or 6 tests in all of stats and secured an A easily in Speech,sadness
What's more I could tell the subjects themselves were coming to me much easier than they did say 5 years ago- so it wasn't simply a matter of more lax evaluation,sadness
None of this is really an achievement of course but it is nice to know that I seem to be improving in areas which were previously more difficult,joy
I dislike the idea of having gaps in my ability; it's the same need for balance that leads to me trying to further develop my natural cross-handedness into ambidexterity,anger
I've always been aware that I excelled verbally at potentially the highest level and so I was best served by following and developing that side of my talents; but I refuse to allow that pursuit and development to leave me lopsided or with deficiencies in other areas,joy
I'm going to have to go out to south London area police station sometime tomorrow,fear
The weather is looking so pleasant that I think the Tube will have to do do for transport,joy
A little unfortunate but at least it saves me from actually walking there,sadness
If it hadn't been so important I'd have refused their invitation anyway- who's going to watch the shop while I'm gone?,sadness
While I've got every faith in my employees abilities I wouldn't like to think about what could happen if,joy
It's good that I'm old enough to learn lessons on my own and not from others either by teaching or example because people are stupid,joy
I saw one guy after another take a piss then leave without washing his hands,surprise
Finally it was my turn I use the facilities go to the sink find myself the only one there and a constant line of guys behind me just filing out again without using the sink,joy
I finally snapped and yelled out the door at the last two DOES ANYONE WASH THEIR FRIGGING HANDS AFTER USING THE BATHROOM ANYMORE??,joy
Disgusted I dried my hands walked out and yelled PIGS! toward the Burger King where a number of them had congregated for a late lunch,sadness
Lovely,joy
While I have no doubt whatsoever that my equipment is clean and disease free (I devote at least as much attention to cleaning that as I do my hands; any women dating these boys should be weary of the possible filth that probably accompanies sexual relations with him if he can't even take care of his hands) I cannot say the same for others and cannot vouch for where their hands have been prior to touching the same surfaces that I have such as the toilet seat flush lever and door handles,sadness
Hey assholes explain to your children where their cold sores came from: Daddy didn't wash his hands in the restroom then he cleaned the ketchup off your face and now you have herpes,disgust
Old guy while it's unlikely that you'll catch something major from a dirty turnpike restroom even a case of the flu could kill at your age,fear
UNCLEAN! should at the very least be a public restroom on the interstate,disgust
Simply entering one should make you feel dirty and in want of a shower,disgust
We saw Descent at the local 'ghetto' theater in the local 'ghetto' mall,sadness
Ask any comedian they usually have a bit about the inability of the childless to relate to parents and vice versa,sadness
Not that Erin has a problem she loves kids and works with them but I've never honestly been much of a kid person,sadness
Older kids sure I can identify with short immature but otherwise rational human beings but little kids?,sadness
You can't beat them you can't yell and foam at the mouth but you can't ignore it either,surprise
The plot was just full of loopholes there wasn't even any gratuitous boobage that you might otherwise associate with a Hollywood movie that stars an entire cast of nothing but athletic women,disgust
No these weren't the oh I'm cute see my ta-tas? kind of athleticly built women these were the see me hang from the roof of a cave by my fingernails type the I don't even need a sportsbra kind of actual athletes,joy
Spoiler warning!,sadness
IF you actually want to see The Descent then stop here and go do your nails or something,sadness
Oh they kill the food outside and bring it inside to eat,joy
Hey shelter you think good deal,joy
I don't find the idea of poking around in the dark deep in the bowels of the earth very entertaining at all I don't think our ancestors devoid of electric flashlights and safety equipment would be any more inclined to risking their life for so worthless an enterprise,joy
Is there food that deep in the cave?,joy
Hell no,anger
If this took place in the wilds of Africa perhaps it might be worth venturing into the earth to escape the large predators that prayed upon human beings so very long ago but even that was well before we took to cave drawing,fear
Holly's gotten really into Dog the Bounty Hunter and we watched an episode of that,joy
It's alright it's like American Choppers in that I enjoy it if there's really nothing else to watch,joy
Major Victory is entertaining but he's got an old-school look to him like the original Batman or Superman,joy
Black suits for Spiderman and Superman for instance,joy
Look at Superman: the original television Reeves was a fatman in tights with no issues his movie successor had human flaws and frailties,joy
Spoiler alert!!,sadness
Cue Our Lady Peace - Superman's Dead good song,joy
Do you worry that you're not liked?,sadness
How long til you break?,surprise
You're happy cause you smile but how much can you fake?,joy
An ordinary boy with an ordinary name but ordinary's just not good enough today,joy
We watch tube for a few hours I watch Holly fold clothes I head to bed in the basement then get up the next morning to watch Spiderman 2 with her and the kids,fear
The turnpike was nuts every asshole from Jersey and Connecticut was apparently heading to Canada,anger
At about Biddeford I jumped-ship and headed up Route One expecting an accident the likes of which I experienced the last time I headed home from NH by myself,surprise
Come Scarborough I jumped back on since Route One was pretty packed and I didn't want to go through downtown Portland,joy
I abandoned the turnpike last time as well shortly after the traffic jam cleared and ended up getting home 4 hours later than expected and having just enough time to get ready for work before heading out again,anger
It kind of sucked,joy
So back on the pike putting up with traffic speeds picked up to well above where they should have been things cleared a little north of Lewiston a little more above Augusta but it was still pretty frigging busy all the way up,joy
Spent some time with her watched a little Storm of the Century on DVD (the bargain bin rules) then took a nap before work where I am now,anger
So I'm not doing shit unless absolutely necessary,anger
I'm so proud of myself,joy
Pete Rose runs over Indians catcher Ray Fosse to score the winning run of the 1970 All Star Game,joy
Yeah cocky supercilious Marco Starnoni who eats as if he had been walking in the desert feasting on nothing but manna for forty years,anger
We scored twelve runs in the 4th inning because of some shoddy defense by Marco's team,anger
In the 3rd inning I tried to score when a throw to third base got away,joy
I came racing down the line as Ryan Shalek picked up the loose ball and fired a strike to home plate,anger
I tucked my shoulder down and leveled a defenseless Joe,sadness
He went flying backwards and landed with a huge thud in the left-handed batter's box,fear
Oh well how often does one see a collision at home plate anyway?,anger
You just have to think though of the consequences when two people meet at one point in that vicious a nature,anger
Who can forget Ray Fosse and Pete Rose's encounter at home plate in the 12th inning of the 1970 All Star Game?,joy
This play remains perdurably etched in baseball history as the greatest play at the plate of all time,fear
Jim Hickman lines a base hit to center Amos Otis comes up firing to the plate the third base coach Leo Durocher waves Pete Rose home the throw brings then Indians' catcher Ray Fosse a few feet up the line and then it happens,anger
Pete Rose knocks Ray Fosse into baseball lore and permanantly knocks his shoulder into a somewhat more precarious place,sadness
So in the end we held on to win by a score of 18-13,joy
That is probably the reason most leagues have banned the runner from destroying the catcher like that,anger
There is nothing like being in a train wreck at home plate especially if you hang on to the ball for the out,anger
It would if it were a constant occurence but that was the first time this year that we had had a collision at home plate and probably the last,anger
There is usually one good hit each season and that is it,anger
Joe said the only sensation going through his body when he hit the ground was that he had to go to the bathroom badly,anger
That was kind of funny,joy
Joe was on third and there was a runner on second with one out in a 6-6 tie in the bottom of the 6th inning,sadness
As I threw one of the pitches back to Billy Joe broke for home plate,sadness
I jumped in front of home plate and the ball deflected off my glove and Joe just crushed me He bounced off me and rolled behind home plate,anger
I turned around and swiped at Joe and missed as he hit home plate with his foot and his whole team just raced to the plate and mobbed him as they won 7-6,anger
He says he and Joe knew we were loading the bases for their two worst hitters to get the game into extra innings so they devised a play that involved Joe's trying to steal home,anger
Ahsan told me that he remembers the collision mostly because the game was being played in the rain and we very rarely play when it's raining,anger
Then he saw the ball lying on the ground and screamed for Joe to touch home,anger
Good night my faithful blog acolytes,joy
I shall catch you later on when I am feeling like writing again,surprise
I liked that I am really happy to be able to ride again,joy
The reason I was at the bank was to check to see if Dad had deposited the 56 dollar Government GST cheque into my account yet,fear
Bonus!,joy
So I went to take out my 60 dollars and it said I couldn't take it because my available funds was limited to 6 dollars,anger
I was pretty bummed out because it meant they put a hold on my cheque I hate when they do that what's the bloody point?,anger
Especially when it's a bloody government cheque,fear
It wouldn't bother me much except the last government cheque I deposited had no hold on it,fear
It was 122 dollars (money I promptly blew on DVD's and Food),joy
So here I am with money RIGHT there that I can't get a hold of and I really want to spend it at the Furmeet on Monday,anger
We furries are going to the Mongolian restaurant for a hangout from 7-9 before the meet because sometimes we like to hang out and go bowling or swim for the meets,joy
I get the feeling Dad doesn't want Sam to go weird on him,disgust
Like I said a while ago Dad said he was gonna buy Sam a pound of weed a 2-4 of beer and a led Zeppelin album so that he had at least one normal kid,anger
He's pretty old fashioned but not rude about it,joy
He's not ignorant just old fashioned (which is pretty damn rare),disgust
We think we're pretty close to letting Sam go with me but I would end up sleeping at Ixyao's again because by the looks of it Loth is spending the night in London again with his girlfriend,joy
Earlier today I put on Elfenking - Seasonspeech and mom asked me if I ever listened to radio music anymore,joy
I pride myself on listening to a wide variety of music,joy
I swelled with pride,joy
Now I need to find a place to put all my stuff at Andrea's I know my DVD shelf would have no problem finding a place in the livingroom but the computer the bed the dresser and my electronics would need to find a home in my room,sadness
There's no way I could put my chairs there and I don't want to trash em I would like to give them to a friend or something at the least,joy
I love my chairs *sniffs*,joy
It took me a while to figure out how to do it but I did finally figure it out and I did what I could to keep Monday night and Tuesday morning open,joy
That's funny I think that we love the furries so much that we're willing to schedule our schooling around the meets,joy
However when I went to submit my timetable I was asked to pay the rest of my tuition,joy
I was kind of confused,joy
as when I asked the representative they said that as long as I paid my 400 dollars I wouldn't have to worry about the rest of my costs until OSAP made a decision and until then I could go ahead schedule and do my thing,sadness
It also said that I have to register for some student success thing and I have to call in,joy
Same deal I have the number written down on a piece of paper so I don't forget when the time comes,joy
And since I put that I was living with mother and she only makes 6000 a year I can almost guarantee that I will get accepted for OSAP and they said they'll pay 8700 for this year,joy
which is crazy good especially if I'm living with Andrea who only asks for internet hydro and food,joy
For me internet would be like 25 bucks hydro another 30 or 40 and food,joy
I do have to pay something like 300 dollars a semester for the Mohawk Brantford to Mohawk Hamilton bus,joy
And the government still owes me 680 dollars,fear
Either way I'm thinking it's looking pretty good,joy
Yeah vulgar I know but even if I had a friend with benefits I would go the way of Andrea and do it to get it out of the way,joy
I get to be ticket bitch and I get more volunteer hours and experience,fear
I finally feel a little more independent,joy
1 print off the OSAP thing the government wants me to,fear
I just need it to get mom's signature then I think I mail it to the government when they decide or something,fear
After that I then make my calls to mohawk to ask about the money issue the tuition and my schedules,anger
Problem is I can't do any of these things right now so I keep them all in mind and become impatient to get access to a phone and I am gonna look up info on the shuttlebus,sadness
Courses just opened up so it's not like I'm late they've been open for a whole 12 hours and I can register until mid September so I've got some time however I don't want to wait that's why I went on the site this morning to do it ASAP,sadness
I have the choice to either go to this Burgessville Rocks thing go to London to watch movies with the Furries or go to Brantford with Jason to sling some haybales and make some more cash (oh yeah Tim owes me like 30 bucks too on top of the 60 in my bank) so apparently I do well with the cash,fear
Anyway the smart part of me says to go to Jason's make some cash get stronger get ready and train my leg to be stronger (like I did on my bike),anger
However the loyal part of me says that since I made a promise to Whit even though it's unpaid work I should go to Burgessville,joy
However the playful devil-may-care part of me tells me to fuck em all and go to London to watch movies with the Furs,anger
In fact I sent her an email and she still hasn't responded so I don't know when she'll be here,anger
Rondoze I think I see the source of our misunderstanding,anger
People like him bug me not because they disagree with me but because when you disagree with them they resort to insults and we all know how men need to have big balls and can't lose to another man people always fall into a fight or as it's known online a flame war,anger
I try to stay out of them as I can't stand my intelligence being lowered to their level but sometimes I just want to do what Jay and Silent Bob did,joy
go to their houses and smash their faces in because they like to aggravate,anger
When I go on a messageboard about movies I like discussing things like which film was better Pirates or Superman,joy
I personally enjoyed Pirates more but I thought Superman was far more artistically done with a fantastic story,joy
Whereas you go on there on one side there are people constantly saying that pirates sucked and that nobody is allowed to like it because it sucked and it was horrible,anger
etc or you have the folks trying to tell you that Superman was horrible,anger
It's disgusting that I have to feel relieved when I find a thread that has people calmly discussing sides of an argument,anger
In case I don't see ya good afternoon good evening and goodnight,joy
I dont like myself quite frankly I dislike myself very much dont ask why cause I couldnt tell you,anger
all I know is I suck (and im not looking for sympathy comments here),sadness
I hate the word better,anger
why cant I just be happy with good enough?,joy
everything could ALWAYS be better so ill never be happy!,anger
but wat the HECK does delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart mean?,joy
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh why do I hate life?!,anger
I just wanna have fun and be happy and simple like all my friends,joy
just giggle giggle giggle thats all they do everyday all day and all they need is a boyfriend and someone to laugh with,joy
Terrorists make me SICK they ought to all be horrifically detained I believe it was the first time in my life I have had to resort to extreme racism,sadness
Perhaps I am just being petty but that did really annoy me It absolutely outrages me as to how evil and canniving these people are,anger
Imagine transporting a bomb fashioned out of a SPORTS DRINK and triggering it with the simplistic flash of a disposable camera,anger
Britain has evidently officially gone to the dogs if the so-called prime minister is in Mexico whilst we could have been dealing with 3 500 innocent lives lost on 10 different jetliners,sadness
So I am thankful to still be alive,joy
Lat night while trying to demonstrate to Tequila Boy how effectlivley I could beat him up if he ever had a complete change of personality and decided to attack me I slipped on the carpet trying to demonstrate a roundhouse kick fell backwards and hit the wall with what I'm assured was a sickening crack,anger
But it didn't hurt and it didn't seem to be bleeding to much so I shrugged ot off and went to bed,sadness
In fact I bought TOILET PAPER of George Bush stupid quotes,disgust
Now I'm on my political soapbox so if you find opposition to the Republican regime distasteful feel free to exit now,anger
On a more serious note just open up any paper or online news provider and you will find things that *should* alarm you and which definitely are bothering me! Here is just an example from Yahoo News:,anger
WASHINGTON - While the British terror suspects were hatching their plot the Bush administration was quietly seeking permission to divert $6 million that was supposed to be spent this year developing new homeland explosives detection technology,fear
We diverted funds from FEMA for this organization which in my mind was directly (and I mean DIRECTLY) tied to the disaster Katrina brought to the South,surprise
That does not even begin to address the loss of our civil liberties and the insidious spread of a Gestapo or KGB-like mentality that most of America just seems to be blissfully unaware of,anger
The government can and WILL find you no matter what steps you take to try and get some privacy,fear
Perhaps I'm being an alarmist but the loss of privacy and personal freedom in the name of security SCARES me I am fine with heightened security at airports,anger
In fact last night my Mom asked me if I am scared of flying and going on our trip,surprise
One such being the slight civil annoyance of another commuter's feet riding pride high on the train seats,anger
Often only concerned in self removal in busy or peak times,sadness
Sadly due to current legal mud pies forcefully conveying the issues and negatives concerned with sitting in such a state are verboten,sadness
Knowing the majority's aversion to confrontations and speaking out a ride with the feet up on the seats can usually last the entirety of a journey,fear
For those who feel powerless and fearful of repercussions yet want to take action there is always something more grating than knowing someone either cannot read or show respect for public seating areas,anger
Away from view and made to be the problem of another set of commuters,sadness
As after all society has been developed to shift blame and anger ad infinitum,anger
Thank God the exam's over,joy
I really hate Ma'am Nario!,anger
if I ever live with a girl that bitch better be clean,anger
I come home after two weeks and our place is fucking disgusting,anger
girlfriends and random sex junk mail and all,joy
gotta love it,joy
I didn't even get a jolt when I saw her face on comments,surprise
it's so weird,disgust
but I guess when you let it all go and you realize it's time to move on and all,surprise
good times,joy
I hate it when certain people always seem to be better at me in everything they do,anger
I guess I'm not going to continue with this any more,surprise
I hope everything will be all right in time to come,joy
I'm still pretty freaked out by the piano exam next week,joy
I guess my fingers could be too,surprise
I dislike negative non-beneficial (to me) change in people and things,anger
I wish other things would change,fear
where has the love in reciprocation gone,joy
The fireworks were beautiful,joy
No words can describe them,anger
The only way to enjoy them is to live that moment,joy
The last time I watched them so close up was back when I was still a young child,joy
Once again I was like caught in the web unable to free myself,sadness
I just wanted someone I can confide about the difficulties I faced at work and the void in my life,sadness
Maslow theory about our basic needs being met and wanting to find other purposes in life,sadness
Yet I do not know the means to achieve them,joy
I feel so lost,sadness
Yet I am helpless to it,sadness
My mouth hurts soooooo much,surprise
I hate going to the dentist well hate is a strong word,anger
I dislike going to the dentist,anger
All those tools buzzing blinding light in the face and the doctor over you with a mask can't tell if his smiling or what,joy
Bad new,anger
don't want them to fall out while chewin' on something,sadness
Playing love and politic are alike you have to say the words without really say them and make sure the opposite party get the impressions you want them to see,anger
And for some reasons I dislike doing politic cause manipulating mostly people are what it does,disgust
My sister will remain in Michigan so I thought I'd be coming back here occasionally but she and I have had several vicious scarring fights this summer,anger
I've considered not coming home for holidays to see my family because I dislike this town so much,anger
No that last one isn't true,joy
(Aren't you a friend of Maggie's? I am Maggie,joy
You look like her I guess!,surprise
The guy sitting next to me started to small-talk slash pick-girl-up-talk,anger
Totally dangerous combination,fear
He disengaged after the second glare,anger
theres to many stories to tell here so I'll just give the general outline of p2p:,anger
mel sully steve adam gibbs artur erin jacqui will leanne nikki justin jeffy steph all the catherines/katies kaela bree sarah grady (future president of 2005 haha) sarah p caitlin g I love you all,joy

I'm really lucky about that,joy
I'm actually pretty good at driving a normal car so I'm excited,joy
I got some great presents and had an awesome 16th birthday ,joy
I'm loving school at Columbia,joy
I feel more at ease now that I kind of know what I want to do with my life but more scared because I feel like everyone is a step ahead of me I have to admit though school has me freaked out about my future,joy
I'm scared to death about getting a job after school,anger
I can't wait but I'm nervous as hell now,fear
What if nothing goes as planned and I can't get a job and I'm stuck doing something that I hate?,anger
She was saying how she had the same area code and that she's from Spring Valley Weird huh?,disgust
I'm excited to go I always like to go to different concerts and plus it will be nice to go out and do something fun,joy
It was definitely a shocking experience but atleast I can say I have ridden in an ambulance before,fear
My mother was there for me the whole time while I was scared to death losing consciousnes and fearing for my life and I will always remember that,sadness
The goal was to go to sleep and never wake up but after taking 32 of those dreadful cold pills that put scars on my kidney in the first place death was becomming all too real too fast,anger
Have you ever wanted to be with someone that is a friend of the other sex but you are afraid to ask that person?,joy
afraid that it would ruin your friendship with them as well as your friendship with another person,joy
afraid that you will be hurt yet again,fear
hurt if that person say's no,anger
Hurt if that person say's yes and down the line you brake up,anger
Hurt by the world of friendship yet again,anger
Hurt by the world of dating,anger
Hurt so bad you stay in a world that is only in your mind,anger
Hurt so bad you stay in your room,anger
Never wanting to go out with someone again,sadness
Today was just kind of stressful,joy
It was definitely a good night of conversation although I did stay up until 12:30 and I payed for that this morning in 1st period (Physics),joy
But all of a sudden today it's hit me that I have all this work due,anger
I have so much long-term work that I'm not sure if I'll get it all finished with band practice every night a football game friday and a competition all day Saturday,anger
But tonight I'm attempting to get a good portion of it finished,joy
I'm starting my argument on illegal immigration (which I may say is turning out fantastic with the first two praragraphs I have) and I finished one of my US History charts and I plan on outlining a bit once I start watching America's Next Top Model,anger
Plus all this stuff is being forced on me with my Dad,fear
The courts and my lawyer and my therapist and my mom are all getting mad because I don't have all this time in the world to hang out with my Dad for a few hours,anger
Love NFL love live it only makes sense,joy
I'm sorry someone died but to mislead me like that is inexcusable,anger
Don't be afraid to weigh in on the subject,fear
Love NFL love live it only makes sense,joy
I'm sorry someone died but to mislead me like that is inexcusable,anger
Don't be afraid to weigh in on the subject,fear
even though I wasnt in the right mood aka : my mind was in portland it was a really good flick!,joy
it was one of the movies I was told to watch,fear
my money my decision,anger
how much would you pay for your safe haven?,joy
what I was worried about someone trying to steal money off my card isnt going to happen,anger
she makes me all nervous and tense!,fear
and anything she says no matter how sweet the voice is is nasty and mean spirited!,joy
I get stuck cant think of the right term and lose my train of thought,anger
and I end up doing what she says because I cant get over the fact I stumbled in a sentence 5 minutes prior,anger
I cant wait to visit portland again though right now I dont think ill be able to go back until I have payed rent,anger
which sucks but that might mean her birthday,joy
but if it takes 2 weeks for me to get a pay check and the first week of work is counted into the next two weeks anyway,joy
so really my first pay check will be in 3 weeks and I cant afford to be late with rent,joy
I might have to borrow from mom since ive payed her off but then shell know I dont have any of the money left and,anger
im afraid of what will happen if that gets out,fear
im worried about money,anger
but im more worried about losing the one I love even though I cant have her right now,sadness
I know this is cheesy and maybe pointless but I am going to say it anyway,sadness
it wasn't too bad,anger
I can handle dull aches it's the sharp pains that freak me out,sadness
Then they fucked around with my teeth which never hurt (except for the clamp) but I was on edge because it felt like it was about to hurt like any moment they might hit a nerve,anger
so the nurse was doing suction and she accidently hit the rubber sheath across my mouth (isolating the tooth) which made a very loud noise in my ear so I flinched and the dentist was like It's not big deal show her it's nothing to be afraid of so she did it again and I really freaked out really flinched and even cried out and then I starting crying,surprise
Anyway it wasn't too bad except they didn't do any fillings so I still have a loser mouth,anger
as unexpectedly and elusively as the innernets appear SO DO THEY STOP DISAPEAR,surprise
enjoying it while it lasts,joy
totally true access hollywood says so,joy
today at work I popped advils and helped a mother and daughter figure out some drapes for the daughter's bedroom,joy
and it turns out that the daughter and I both graduated from brockport this spring!,joy
her degree is in dance which is about as useful as my studio art degree,joy
she's living at home with her parents now and she's not feeling very good about herself,joy
fingerless gloves or bust so help me god,joy
something good is going to happen if it kills me I think I threw out my back hunching over (hence the advils) but that's nothin!,joy
Which to be honest was making Brad slightly nervous,fear
Perhaps it had just been pre-deal excitement,joy
Brad had promptly fallen asleep having been up at dawn to make it across the island for the deal that morning,joy
An almost 24 hour day was not Brad's idea of a good time,joy
But in the meantime he had free time as Deguchi was passed out in his room from too much liquor and too little sleep and the desire to be as perky as possible for his golf game tomorrow,anger
It was a pleasant Tuesday evening in Hawai'I Wednesday at home Brad reminded himself automatically and he had the doors to the balcony open wide and was sitting on the lone chair looking out over the ocean,joy
He called Yohji missing him wanting to talk to him,sadness
Instead I went shopping for sandals to wear to graduation,joy
It's two-piece green stretch velvet,joy
In Drawing we played Ms Wolf's Fun Game,joy
It actually was quite a bit of fun,joy
The Fun Game itself involved cardboard boxes with mystery items in them and our job was to decorate the boxes any way we wanted,joy
When it came time to trade boxes and open them people kept avoiding mine because it left blue paint all over anyone who touched it,fear
Pacheco asked if he could put some on me and he painted me up like a cat with green-and-purple whiskers and a smudgy pink heart for the tip of my nose,disgust
He asked if I could help make him up like a clown and then the two of us painted Ryan's face like a hooker,joy
After Drawing I was standing at Ryan's locker leaning back laughing,joy
I was laughing up at Josh Bloomfield and Peter when someone spoke softly behind me very fast,joy
I wanted to wipe the green-and-purple whiskers off with my hands but was afraid of making it worse so I didn't do anything,fear
Ryan was kind of standing on the outside of the group which makes sense I guess,joy
He's not on the football team,joy
I said He always seems so nervous,fear
I feel kind of bad,anger
And - you know Leif Carlson? - me and Leif sat together and that guy shows up late on the first day of class and he was at our same table,sadness
He - you know he had that big coat and his hair was all shiny and slicked back - and he doesn't smile - so we just thought Ryan waved his hands abruptly to show what it was they thought,joy
All we were doing was just kind of,joy
hurting his feelingsRyan finished flatly,anger
I nodded felt guilty,anger
When I am really actually honest I'm just as superficial as anybody else,anger
Love,joy
Goodbyes break my heart and make me choke on my last words,anger
They cause tears to run down my cheeks and make me want to fall to my knees,sadness
I'm so scared that everytime that I see you it's going to be my last time and I never want to leave your side,surprise
my quilt is finally coming along though I am alsorts of excited,joy
You say you want a revolution,anger
We all want to change the world,fear
We all want to change the world,fear
But when you talk about destruction,anger
But when you want money for people with minds that hate,anger
You say you'll change the constitution,fear
We all want to change your head,fear
As long as capitalism reigns in America the gulf between the haves and the have-nots will widen until it is an insurmountable chasm filled with the broken bodies of whipped slaves,fear
Pretty damn sad isn't it?,anger
What will it take to rise above and leave this human ashtray that we've been snubbed into?,surprise
It will take radical thought change,fear
It will take a revolution,anger
Words and phrases like terrorist anti-semitic anti-war Islamo-fascist protest and communist,anger
That last one alone has been responsible for more fear-mongering than the presently seated Bush administration has been able to muster in the past six years and that's a pretty tall order,joy
The BOO! machine runs full-time at the White House these days,joy
What's interesting about their motivations is that most of what we're supposed to be afraid of is actually simply informative alternatives to the status quo: the fear of change,fear
The government wants us to be afraid of terrorists so that they can pass more questionable legislation that makes it easier to control us,fear
They want us to not criticize the Zionists who give the Jews a bad name because of how much Zionists influence US foriegn policy in the name of Israel,anger
They want us to be scared of protesting and dissenting in the name of freedom because there are more of us than there are of THEM,joy
I even suggest that the government has always wished us to be afraid of communism because it goes against the very thing that government relies upon to keep it rolling: capitalism,fear
From the Red Scare and the Communist witch-hunt of the 50's with Senator Joe McCarthy aggressively pursuing perceived threats to the safety and security of America to the current fear and loathing of so-called communist countries such as North Korea Cuba and China actual communism has never ever existed,anger
Dictators like Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Il oversee police-states but aren't purveyors of actual communism as espoused by Marx,anger
But whereas earlier socialists often favored longer-term social reform Marx and Engels believed that popular revolution was all but inevitable and the only path to socialism,fear
Even within so-called modern communism there are many splits and factions notably between Marxist/Leninist communists and anarchists,anger
While perusing the pages detailing the battle of words I ran across a detailed look at just what the revolution might look like if it truly indeed ever happened,anger
For that matter it looks as if it could be happening right now no matter what -ism you slap it with,anger
Recipe for a revolution?,anger
And it makes pretty clear the idea that the continuation of this charade of voting booths and elected officials is never going to turn America around and make it the Utopia that many hope it will become; unless the people get serious about organizing and ceasing this selfish alienating style of life that we cling to,joy
The very act of revolution demands a will stronger than Dancing With The Stars Cribs and the latest incarnation of CSI,anger
Only after we have been put through the schools which teach us not to think for ourselves or question what we're taught only after we're encouraged to seek higher learning in order to make the highest dollar do we then enter a life-long engagement in a vocation that keeps us away from the things we actually wish to do,joy
The dream that you can fight hard and work to get ahead put money away and eventually leave the factory of human flesh at age 65 to finally live what's left of your shriveled life aided by the promise of a Social Security plan that our dear leader the Decider is actually trying to privatize just like our national banking system,joy
It's a depression,sadness
Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job,anger
The dollar buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it,anger
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat,joy
And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be!,anger
We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is Please at least leave us alone in our living rooms,surprise
Just leave us alone,surprise
Well I'm not going to leave you alone,surprise
I want you to get mad!,anger
I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street,anger
All I know is that first you've got to get mad,anger
I'm as mad as hell ,anger
Have you ever felt longing?,sadness
Just at the mere thought of the source of longing makes you want to cry to sob out the truth of your heart?,sadness
Longing is not for the faint of heart but longing will make you weak in the heart,sadness
It will alter you judgement longing will destroy you,sadness
The only thing is where I work is a tax law firm place and I don't know any of the terms so I'm learning as I go!,sadness
Luckily I don't have to do much with numbers cause I deal mostly with the phone oh and did I mention they don't mind if we're on AIM check our e-mail or look up random stuff online as long as we get our work done?,joy
It's pretty sweet and I feel very blessed that I have it,joy
Oh and my mentor she's Catholic and she teaches CCD so me and her get along pretty good,joy
Well I guess we'll see what happens later with my job,surprise
I suppose it's mostly my fault,sadness
I won't pay attention in class and miss assignments I'm always afraid I'm going to forget to do something or something's gonna spring up on me and AAAAAAH!!!,joy
I can't pay attention I can't think straight I can't even talk,joy
People will be talking and I'll want to join in on the conversation but I won't have anything to SAY so when I do say something it's last minute and flustered and everybody looks at me like,anger
Today I was pulled out of a meeting by our building manager who was in a blind panic,fear
The problem turned out to be that I needed to choose a paint color for the walls of the new office space,sadness
This was apparently an emergency,surprise
Nurse a can of the 47 crocus blue satin finish!,sadness
Anyway we tracked down the paint chip sample brochure buried on the receptionist's desk and I pulled out my carpet samples preparing to face my daunting choice--which turned out to be between two nearly identical shades of office off-white,sadness
I went with the slightly more creamy white rather than the slightly more grey white,joy
The other is appalling crap: disorganized blatantly pseudoscientific and misogynistic,disgust
The pseudoscience could probably be blamed at least in part on its late-70s vintage - maybe things like multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia were so poorly understood and poorly approached at the time that this gobbledegook was passable (or else maybe these disorders were so poorly understood that they were as hokey to established science as poltergeists),fear
I suppose attitudes towards women have changed a lot too but this was so awful I threw up my hands and returned the book before leaving the library,anger
He goes on to describe her in later years as unhappily married fat and sullen,sadness
Hello hostile much?,anger
The result is that all of his comments about the sexual energy of any of his (mostly female mostly pubescent) subjects come out with a kind of leer behind them,joy
It wasn't performed by Lionel Ritchie this time but by Faith No More,joy
There's currently a commercial on rotation I advertising what capitalistic piece of crap it is this time but it is a terrible terrible cover of In a Big Country,disgust
I also heard somewhere that the song was covered by Dashboard Confessional,fear
I see this commercial every morning; it is an omen for a very bad day,fear
We have all had (or are still having perhaps for the rest of our lives) our encounters with stupid people but it's the ones who just won't stop bothering you that are among some of the worst,anger
Somebody fucking invited me to a Facebook group called Sally is cooler than your mom,surprise
But then again even my mom is greater than Sally,surprise
I'd like to tell Sally to go eat shit,anger
Three angry customers; as a matter of fact that last week alone at Pier 1 was the only week where I met troublesome customers,anger
An omen?,fear
Good deal,joy
Oh I know the kids who are voted Best Dressed in school,joy
Isn't it aggravating when someone is practically demanding you to hang out with them?,anger
Go find someone else to be your bitch,anger
Sure it's nice to see people wanting to be within your presence but when they step over the line and enter the realm of stupidity self-esteem issues and denial of self-being well then I want to do nothing but kick you in the fucking baby maker,anger
I get such a laugh out of that every time,joy
That is probably a good thing,joy
or maybe there is nothing worth comment upon??)and that influences what I share too,joy
I struggle with the Catholic concept of baptism being a gift we give infants because it is God's gift to us,joy
Having the girls baptized is not something I will regret as I plan to raise them cognizant of and faithful to the faith,joy
They can always choose not to go to church,joy
And maybe having been baptized Catholic they will come back to the church,joy
I an not afraid of having lots of children,fear
I am not afraid of having another child,joy
I just know having another one right now would cause great havoc in the tender new environment that Dave and I have with the girls now,anger
God does know what is best,joy
And God provided all sorts of opportunities for us to use knowledge in regard to family planning,joy
The next time I actually get you on the phone when you're not a)tired b)not in the mood or c)just plain not wanting to talk to me please don't elect to watch a movie instead of having a conversation with me It's these types of choices that make it hard for me to justify trying to be your friend,joy
Me: Yah uh I was with about 12 other people ready to watch a movie we were supposed to start an hour before for a class Kinda already planned,fear
It's those types of choices that make it hard for me to justify a friendship,joy
Im rather sick of myspace,sadness
Im not particularly interested in what ANY of his blogs have to say,sadness
Ive noticed an abundance are usually about me and rather stupid,joy
every once in awhile one or two titles will catch my eye and I will read it but for the most part I really am sick and tired to stupid repetitive shit,disgust
Not to mention the same learning experiences and new discoveries or opinionated ideas towards me that always seem to change week to week so whatever,anger
Gag enough on that crap,disgust
Anyways I went to Court yesterday,anger
Court was intimidating but I did good,anger
Traffic court is uh a lot more serious than I thought,anger
And It got ruled that it was my vehicles fault not mine and the I got minimum sentence possible for my ticket,sadness
I actually got it pretty good,joy
The exciting part of my day as cliche as it sounds was a car fire,joy
No biggy but it was not angled (no popped tire) and the smoke was dark black I know that's not normal,sadness
This kid was in the back seat with the door open and his leg hanging out,anger
So I Told him it was on fire I dont think he heard me So I grabbed his smeater and yanked him out of the car he stumbled back dropped his shit and looked at me pissed what the fuck lady we got about four or five steps from the vehicle when the gas tanked popped (not a hollywood explosion here people) and burning gas flew out everywhere catching the grass on fire blowing out both rear tires and because the door was open the interior of the vehicle started going up in flames,fear
after some silence from the driver his attitude changed and hes like thanks that could have been me and repeated oh my god while I got an ETA on police and fire from dispatch and gave her information,fear
All this before court,anger
The news people showed up talked to the kid and he pointed at me while I was telling the cop I had to go because I really did not want to be late and I left,fear
Point is it was exciting,joy
he gave me a hug that was good,joy
How do you know that smoke is not from a tire and the car could be on fire??,fear
People drive by this stuff everyday I think I look at it differently because of my experiences and the department so I stop,surprise
I've homework to do,fear
And I want to go to buffalo wild wings with Jen,surprise
the speedometer broke on my way down but it decided to fix itself,sadness
But uncle beeve saved the day and fixed a bunch of stuff for me Called it an early Birthday present he is so amazing,joy
Than I drove to lake wood around familiar routes to try and get my confidence back with driving,joy
While I was in lakewood I surprised Brian and we met Scooty for lunch suprised him too,surprise
It feels pretty good today,joy
So Im going out with some friends later do some homework both our work uniforms are dirty (all of them) so I think I might do laundry and make our bed,fear
Good to love life,joy
They both just lost their husbands and Vegas grandma has had more time were hoping she will help Canada grandma feel better,sadness
Which I am so happy for,joy
I am so proud of my sister,joy
im sick of looking at a computer screen,sadness
I can't relate to 99% of humanity,joy
After watching the middle-aged geeky character Seymour (Steve Buscemi) in Ghost WorldI can't but help agreeing with him,fear
Okay I can relate to more than 1% of humanity but lately I don't like it's more than 25%,joy
And I don't mean don't fit in in a sort of sad-emo-subculture-wearing black all the time thing,sadness
There is a type and he's very elusive,surprise
But back to reasons that I don't relate to 74% of humanity:,joy
sex and money,joy
- I don't think that the place to meet a potential love interest is at a party,joy
(And you know what kind I mean because parties in general are okay but I mean drunken ragers and the like),joy
(Has anyone seen this week's Rolling Stone?,anger
I am quite honestly furious and they WILL be getting an angry letter from me even though won't care I'm sure because as much as they would like you to think that they aren't part of the machine they are,anger
- I don't like the movie Top Gun,anger
- I enjoy reading,joy
- I don't think money buys happiness,joy
I don't think sex begets happiness,joy
People are just rude and selfish and I know I'm victim too but I don't want to be like that,anger
I get the feeling that a lot of people want to be like that,joy
It's part of getting older and that sounds cliched that makes me realize that I'm not a fan of the typical college girl thing,sadness
When are people going to step it up and join humanity,joy
or at least the percentage I can deal with?,joy
And where are the intelligent attractive respectful guys who aren't frat boys who just wear jeans and t-shirts and $30 tennis shoes who like to read and watch movies?,fear
And who have some sense of style but are still kind of dorky but have social skills?,joy
So I kept walking straight and the dog that crossed the street turned around and saw me and growled I was likeoh shit Jorge just keep walking,anger
I knoe im skinny but DAMN!!,anger
It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance,joy
It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance,surprise
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live,fear
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long ,anger
It's the second stanza that caught my attention; more specifically it's those two first lines: It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance/It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance,fear
Nothing grand mind you; this is one that must be handled with a delicate touch: nothing rash nothing rushed let it flow,disgust
I have considered the possibility for a while now but I have been apprehensive and I did not act on what I felt,fear
And then just the other day I was driving down 470 on the way to college listening to 1055 and a beautiful song came on that I had not heard before,joy
Naturally it took a few lines to catch my attention and I began to pay attention just as those two lines were being sung by Ms Middler,fear
The words made me think Now I have thought and thought and you who know me best will not be surprised that I thought some more ,anger
Internship was pretty awesome today,joy
I love the two guys who work at that Starbucks - they're awesomely flamboyant and they told me about how Cameron Diaz came in for a latte during their shift last week (but without Justin!,joy
I didn't see Will Smith (although the French Prince is usually my shit I think I would have had to punch him on behalf of everyone who's heard Switch) but the girl on the elevator with me said she had just randomly seen Mike Myers,anger
That afternoon - *gulp* - Lawler came to observe me When I heard she was coming I spazzed afraid that she might have an issue with the fact that I never you know handed in any of my internship forms,fear
Of course as soon as she came in John came over and said You realize Molly that you're not allowed visitors and we will have to give you thirty more lashes,disgust
Ms Lawler just kept smiling awkwardly,joy
Then she proceeded to call me Meghan** and went through the required but hilariously inapplicable hazardous chemicals/safety concerns set of questions while the interns around me tried to stifle their laughter,joy
I'm kind of freaking out about debate but I'm kind of okay,joy
I'm pretty sure you can see him during The Onion segment in The Aristocrats,joy
Good news,joy
I was called in and 2 guys interviewed me I was completely honest throughout the interview from telling them about the handcuff story with Danika to the dirty joke story when I was working at the movie theatre,disgust
At one point I apologized for being so nervous and they told me that there were people a lot worse and that I wasn't using the words uh and um as often as others had been,fear
Everything looks good,joy
Where they will decide to place me is up to them as long as I get the job I'll be really happy,anger
I felt really awful through out the whole day too,anger
That one chick I dislike with a passion because I think she is obsessed with Gareth and really likes him,anger
I really do hate it,anger
I left it but through out the whole day I was really awful,anger
when I got home I was really nervous I hadn't talk to Gareth for 2 days because of college,fear
So I tell him it took me FOREVER To tell him but I was shakey and nervous to,fear
Then he said that he's not worried about her taking him away from me,sadness
He's like Would it make me happy that I delete her off my friends list and messenger,joy
because I dislike her very much,anger
And I hate these mistakes I do,anger
Man I hate it,anger
Ill miss you always forever and ever,anger
My baby you'll be,joy
I'm so down right now I can't be anymore upset,anger
